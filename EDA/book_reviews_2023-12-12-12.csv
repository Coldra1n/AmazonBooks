Not a good book to learn Data Science. It's just a notebook of the author which he introduced in the market in printed form. Just  a business trick to earn some quick money. It's clear from the absence of any name of the publisher. No proper explanation on any topic. Couldn't learn R too. Refer to other book for Data Science.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis Using R (Low Priced Edition): A Primer for Data Scientist

Easy way to learn R with this book. Value for money.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis Using R (Low Priced Edition): A Primer for Data Scientist
"I got the book promptly.  It has that softbound textbook feel.  but good binding not cheap or ready to fall apart.  the intormation in it so far seems interesting and well organized.  its in the ""head first format"" which means there is a lot of nice visual lay out and side notes and some graphics to make understanding the concepts by seeing them when possible.  I like that format.  It is still pretty clean and gets to the point.  but I have only read and used so much of it at this point so I cannot go much farther into the content than that.  -- in short I think it is a solid book to get if one wants to better understand how to interpret social science numbers,  or other scientific numbers that they are shown in a way that they are wise to various ways that data can be spiked and spiced.  how in depth I cannot comment on as I have not fully digested the book.  But it is a book that is designed to be both read and used as a topical reference.  And it has the ""Head First"" style keeping things clean but providing insightful commentary, context and graphical illustrations where it might really speed up or enhance understanding of a particular idea or complicated example.  it also uses bolding in areas where you can pay attention to the new vocabulary you might want to learn in order to lay the ground work for even more technical education in data analysis.  it even has a chapter where it goes over some of the more obscure plug ins for excel that are there for helping a person analyze data.  I would basically treat this book as a nice survey of both the human technical sides of data analysis.  it also covers things like data collection or effective data presentation,  and as I said it refers to several readily available tools like excel for example and how they can be used by someone who wanted to know how to leverage their computer in order tame and extract meaning from data they have been given to interpret.  -- I think that its a useful primer  that is like a survey course in the subject sans the professor.  But how good each section is I cannot comment on as I have only started with the book for a several weeks.  but  what I did read I found completely intelligible and because I am not a total novice at looking at Data,  there were times I could use its nice formatting to skip past explanations I did not need because I already was familiar with them.  If I fall in love with the book I may come back and say so and make my stars 5 instead of a 4 but at this point I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wanted a nice primer that went into to a very serviceable level of detail for a primer or survey type information source.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"
"This was a beautiful book that really refueled my interest for Statistics (which I've been struggling to start learning...even though I know calculus and LOVE mathematics)...but it really caught my eye because it goes into detail about the R statistical programming language.The first few chapters get you going on a specific mindset of how to interpret data, which is VERY important to keep throughout the entire reading of this book.After that groundwork is established, you are taken on a really cool journey of some Excel features (don't freak out...those of you who don't know excel proficiently will be fine in the hands of this book) that you never would've believed were there! You can even use Google Docs to do the same things if you don't have a valid copy of Excel!Finally, R comes into play with all its glory...I would've loved for a deeper dive with this technology, but there are several other books out there in which you can get down and dirty with R (http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Programming-Statistical-Software/dp/1593273843/ and http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-OReilly-Cookbooks-Paul-Teetor/dp/0596809158/ are my favorites and I own them both on my kindle).I hope that eliminates all your FUD's (Fears, Uncertainties, and Doubts)...go and grab this book RIGHT NOW! You'll be blown away with what you'll be able to do after you read everything here!P.S. It only takes about a week and a half to get through it going at a nice, slow, and comfortable pace...if you're HUNGRY like I was, you can knock it out in about 4 days.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"
"Going through this book for introductory Data Analysis elements has been extremely helpful, especially in later chapters utilizing ""R"".Pros:  1) Great introductory material to Data Analysis, including reporting techniques and later chapters including hands on examples utilizing ""R"".  2) Extremely easy read, was able to cover the material in the span of 1-2 work days and feel as though most of the information has been absorbed.Cons:  1) The binding is really poor (it might just be my copy). When I opened the book I had a handful of pages just fall out. I needed the book for work, so there wasn't much of an option to wait while returning it. I'll just have to fix the binding myself later.  2) Multiple areas that have typos or missing data. For the most part I was able to figure out what was being explained, but some links for data were incorrect.Wishes:  1) A section containing data collection techniques would have been wonderful. Sometimes you aren't given the data, and are expected to retrieve the data needed for analysis.  2) A section covering creating models and analysis based on best/worst/average case estimates from subject matter experts. What to do while waiting for needed data.Aside from the glaring issues mentioned, I would still recommend this book to anyone who needs an introductory book to Data Analysis.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"
SQL in legman’s terms. Very helpful.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"
"This book provides an excellent, approachable introduction to data analysis. Although most experienced professionals or advanced students will find this text trivial, it serves as a god starting point for those who are completely new to data analysis. The text provides numerous interactive examples using Excel and R, but the examples do not cover these tools in any great depth. If you're looking to learn more about statistics, data analysis and data mining, this book is a good starting point.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"
The book itself is useful. I like the way it takes the reader through one example problem at a time and guides the thought process needed to solve the problem. The only thing I don't like is that the print is so faint on some of the pages that I can hardly read it. It looks like a bad printing job or like the presses were running out of ink when this book was created. Some of the screen shots are so washed out (very pale gray color) that I can't see what I am suppose to click on.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"
"While some of the Head First series have been quite helpful, this one has way too much fluff, making it tedious to find the important content.  By way of example, the entire page 97 is devoted to ""Profits fell through the floor"" with a picture of a sad person, a picture of a pile of rubber ducks, a sample letter expressing a complaint, and the conclusion that ""this is pretty bad news."" Page 97 lies in the middle of the ""optimization"" chapter, but you don't get to the punch line on what to do about the ""pretty bad news"" until page 108. The pace of the book is simply too slow--which I attribute to an overuse of the Head First style, a style supposedly ""designed for the way your brain works."" My brain would have been happier if the editors had picked up the pace.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"
"Different problems need different methods to be solved properly. This book takes various examples and lets the reader work through the problems. It is actually fun to read this book. Very well explained. Of course, not all the problems worked 100%, but I have not read a book with examples and problems that all work. Especially, some of my R did not work too well. Other than that it is a great book, and a great way to learn about data analysis.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions"

"This is my current favorite ""general"" book on Excel.  There are a few other books on specific features of Excel (such as Tables, PowerQuery, and VBA) that I would probably rank slightly higher as they provide more depth on their specific areas.  But this book touches a lot of topics while staying very practical.  There are numerous features, tips, and warnings that intermediate and advanced Excel users will benefit from.My only complaint is that the book is printed in black & white.  Some images would benefit from being in color or at a minimum more nuanced shading as the background theme is quite dark.

"I got this book when I was transitioning to doing data science with Python and was struggling to become familiar with standard tools. It's written by the creator of Pandas, and follows the style of the Pandas documentation: dense, telegraphic, peppered with examples.It's hard work because Wes McKinney often does not articulate why you would need to do something (assuming you are already knowledgeable on the underlying process), and writes like an impatient person who would rather be doing something else. Additionally examples often suffer from being both too long and too short - too long in that almost every example is on a toy dataset created from scratch, too short in that most of those datasets have only 5 or 10 elements and do not always showcase complex operations. Other examples (particularly involving time series) have an overabundance of data that make the critical results hard to spot. Frankly, my first month with Pandas was a miserable one.But I give the book 5 stars both because I came to love Pandas as I got more familiar with it, and because while McKinney is not fun to read, he does pack the book with useful information and it is (mostly) well organized. If anything it would benefit from being longer and with a more patient treatment of larger and more concrete datasets (eg the Titanic passenger dataset used in the Pandas documentation). The initial chapter on the basics of using Python could go - if you need this book, then you don't want to be trying to learn the rudiments of Python from it. If you can accept that you'll need a lot of bookmarks or margin notes to get through a rather steep learning curve, it will reward your persistence.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"
"This book has been my foundation of using python as a data analyst.This book primarily focuses on the pandas Python library, which is awesome at processing and organizing data (Python pandas is like MS Excel times 100. This is not an exaggeration). It also introduces the reader into numpy (lower level number crunching and arrays), matplotlib (data visualizations), scikitlearn (machine learning), and other useful data science libraries. The book contains other book recommendations for continuing education.Although this would be a challenging book for a brand new Python user, I would still recommend it, especially if you are currently doing a lot of work in MS Excel and/ or exporting data from databases. I had a few false starts learning Python, and my biggest stumbling block was lack of application in what I was learning. This book puts practical tools in the reader's hands very quickly. I personally don't have time to make goofy games etc. that other books have used as practice examples. Despite other reviews criticizing the use of random data throughout the book, I found the examples easy to follow and useful. I would also argue that learning how to generate random data is useful in itself (thus the purpose of the numpy random library), and that there are practical examples throughout the book. Chapter 14 devoted to real-world data analysis examples.I am almost finished with my second time through the book, this time working through every example. This book has been well worth the hours spent in it. For context, I previously relied on Excel, SQL, and some AutoHotKey. This book has significantly improved how I work.Thanks, Wes and team.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"
"This book covers all of the basics that you would want to know to get started in programming in Python for data analysis, as the title implies, but it doesn't really offer compelling real-world examples. The data seem to be made up and the analyses don't go into enough detail to help you really learn how pandas and numpy work. Overall this is a decent starter book but you will have to bookmark the python and pandas documentation online if you want to have a reference to all of the functionality those tools have, and there are many places online where you can get better examples to learn from. If you haven't made your mind up about which tool to use for data analysis, I highly recommend checking out dplyr in R, which has an excellent free book online (R for data science, hadley wickham). I find it very easy to learn and it is much easier to set up R and RStudio than it is to set up Python, even though I love Python and Pandas.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"
"Great reference to get started with numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. If you’re already familiar with these libraries, I wouldn’t recommend, as it is easier to just google the functions you’re trying to implement. The examples are good but would've been stronger if there was a story to them. Right now they are disjointed examples so it is a bit time consuming understanding the data set and goal for each example when you're looking at 100 examples all using different data.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"
Well written by the creator of Pandas.  The author's copious use of code snippets to illustrate his points makes the material very usable.  The snippets are short enough to type by hand so you get the  frequent opportunity to play with the code and really understand the tools being presented.  And Pandas is awesome!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"
"The book is mostly about the capabilities of Pandas + Jupyter notebook (and a little on Numpy). The book is structured to be best as a reference book instead a narrative from start to finish. The problem with this approach is for kindle readers like myself, I find myself using stack overflow to look for answers more than searching for it in this book.It was useful to go through the book once, but i won't be using it often from here onward. I suspect that it will become outdated quickly and getting answers to specific questions from Google is usually much faster and more reliable.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"
"First of all, if you've never used python before find an intro to python. This book is more for people who are familiar to intermediate python programmers. Meaning this is not for the complete beginner.The book mainly deals with introducing you to Numpy and Pandas libraries used for data analysis, such cleaning, manipulating wrangling, processing and visualisation.Its a great book to have as a reference and learning data analysis techniques. There are plenty of code examples.  So worth the purchase.Only negative I wish there were mini projects to learn from.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"
"As others have said, this book provides a good manual. If you have a project in mind and some programming background, you can adapt the examples in the book to complete the task.  That said, a lot of the book reads more as documentation than instruction, and the documentation is more sparse than the official pandas documentation. Furthermore, some of the examples are rather opaque in understanding the main point, and the use of random number generators for example data manipulation sometimes makes it difficult to understand what a specific block of code is doing.Overall, this book provides a jumping off point in understanding the capabilities of pandas as well as its strengths, but it wasn't terribly useful in even basic data science workflow and concepts.  For that, I highly recommend something like Hadley Wickham's ""R for Data Science,"" which is much more approachable and rewarding in its use of example datasets, its more personable writing style, and its outlining of good practices for data science.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython"
"In addition to details about the Pandas library for Python, the author also includes solid sections about the python language and NumPy.

"So far, this book has been an inspiring reading. It contains a huge number of data cleansing, transformation, analysis & etc. code snippets. The code is very clean and - for the most part - self-explaining (at least,  for a seasoned software developer). The book step by step displays the motivations behind the design and functionality of center-piece Python modules - and you would not expect anything less from the original designer of Pandas. I feel this wonderful book being a natural extension of ageless Practical CS classics by Niklaus Wirth, Kernighan-Ritchie, and B.

"I did not find the information in the book to be of the value paid.-In an attempt to keep the book as relevant for as long as possible, the author made vague instructions for each command and purposely avoided more complicated issues that can arise. You would expect a book about data analysis to get a little more in depth and complicated.-You can also tell the book was written at different times for each command, there was no natural flow to the book, like you were getting a different author on each page/subject. Although he did say in the beginning of the book that it was pretty much as such.-As my headline says, this is a book of commands with recycled info. These same subjects are covered in greater depth in other books I've read that did not even advertise themselves as a ""data analysis"".Recommended alternative author: Michael Alexander - ex.

"Ms. Clarke's follow-up to How to Win With Data Visualizations is a highly useful work that now has a place in my supplemental teaching curriculum. Focused on the processes students need to master to use data effectively, her informal yet informative style leads the reader through the basics of data science in a manner that I have found effective with my students. Well covered topics include the nature of data science, what variables are and how they are used gives a solid foundation for subsequent topics. Particular attention is paid to the nature of data collection (critical in the lab science courses I teach) and how to organize it for later use is well structured. An interesting discussion of ""cleaning your data"" emphasizes something most students seem not to understand when they arrive in the class. Simply put, too many learners figure that if they glean data (from the Internet most often but also from their own labwork or studies) that is the end of it. Ms. Clarke marries the concept of data healthe to personal health and thus makes an excellent connection. She suggests a process that is workable and in practice in my classes in the spring of 2022, yielded a more solid approach than I had used previously.Subsequent discussions build on the foundations Ms. Clarke established earlier on and give the reader fertile ground to grow and individualize their own understanding of how data can be put to one's use be it in education as I do or running a business (which I used to do).Overall I would recommend this work for those interested in upping his/her/she/them/etc.'s skills in data usage.

"Professionally, I work a lot with quantitative data, through mathematics/biostatistics, building software, and research design. The world of words has long been a domain that has enchanted me even though symbols have comprised my main language. Recently, my wife has started graduate work using qualitative methods. I decided to fill my deficits in this world by reading this book. I am by no means expert or even experienced in it, but I merely have an interest.This book seems to be the seminal work in its field. The authors share their wisdom and experiences in this accessible textbook, now in a fourth edition. They cover the entire process from design and data collection to building a theory. They talk at length about coding as well as how to present your data. They even have a chapter on writing, with many encouragements to not be boring!The graphics and illustrations in this book are excellent and inspirational. I am always interested in creating visualizations to communicate research data effectively, and this book provided many muses in that regard. They talked about converting written accounts into concept maps and linking those to address “influences and affects” of a weak sort of causality. This book helped slow my mind down about the many moving parts in qualitative research so that I can focus more on a work’s reality and substance.This book is obviously geared towards researchers, whether new or old. The writing and presentation are accessible enough so that graduate students would be well-served by reading this work. Practitioners, of course, can benefit as well, but they likely would have read one of the prior three editions of this book. Those who, like me, are involved in other parts of the research enterprise can learn about their colleagues’ work, too. Finally, those who spend significant time building visuals to communicate concepts can learn from these authors’ analytical techniques.After finishing this work, I’m inspired about the myriad of ways non-quantitative data can be analyzed and concisely communicated to readers – especially in ways that aren’t written prose. Poetry, artful presentations, summarizing graphics, and matrix-tables together can create a mosaic to comport meaningful and accurate understanding to readers. My personal bar has been raised, and I suspect many other readers’ bars will be, too.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Qualitative Data Analysis: A Methods Sourcebook

Es aquí donde el libro de Análisis Cualitativo de Datos de Miles, Huberman & Saldaña (2020) en su cuarta edición ilumina las posibilidades.Acostumbrado a la oferta competente de productos editados por Sage (no todos, pero sí la mayoría), la posibilidad de leer previamente el índice y algo del contenido en línea a través de Google Libros, me convenció de que sería una buena guía... y no me defraudó.Con un lenguaje accesible, siempre abierto a considerar que cada caso de investigación es único y que los contenidos presentados son sugerencias resultado de experiencias profesionales (pero no por eso recetas únicas de cómo proceder), el libro guía al lector a través de tres etapas para: 1) Tener una idea básica, pero amplia de lo que implica el análisis de datos cualitativos, 2) Cómo manejar los datos obtenidos en términos de: exploración, descripción, ordenamiento, explicación y predicción y 3) Cómo obtener y verificar las conclusiones obtenidas.Al ser una edición actualizada (al momento de esta reseña al menos), el contenido contempla un elenco de herramientas tecnológicas especializadas para el análisis de datos con funciones que permitan agilizar su procesamiento (recordando siempre que son solo eso, herramientas, no sustitutos del procesamiento intelectual que corresponde al investigador).Con una lógica de ""Descripción --> aplicaciones --> Ejemplo(s)"", el libro asegura la facilidad de comprensión para casi todos los casos que presenta. Las ilustraciones y tablas que acompañan sus explicaciones, son sencillas de seguir e interpretar como ejemplos.Opté por la versión impresa dado que, aunque la edición digital es más ""accesible"" en costo, eventualmente depende de dispositivos electrónicos para su consulta, algo que no siempre resulta benéfico a largo plazo (habrá a quienes les resulte indistinto el formato, pero yo lo he intentado y las versiones impresas facilitan más mi concentración). Tal vez, buscando maximizar las ganancias y reducir costos, en la versión impresa el formato del libro es relativamente grande y las letras de tamaño pequeño (como un Times New Roman de 10 pts. aprox.), resultando en un formato poco práctico para su manejo. Comparativamente ""The Coding manual for cualitative resarches"" (Saldaña, 2021), tiene un poco más de páginas pero su tamaño de formato resulta mucho más práctico de manejar.El gran pero es el precio que, en México al menos, son palabras mayores (alrededor de USD$80.00 al tipo de cambio el día de la reseña). Ojalá que este tipo de publicaciones, que bien podrían ser libros de texto para mejorar el proceso de investigadores/as en formación, tuvieran un costo más accesible sin tener que optar por versiones digitales.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Qualitative Data Analysis: A Methods Sourcebook
The Product is well structured and contains good descriptions of how qualitative data analysis is done. I as a student like the setup and logic.  it isn't dry duo the theory instead  it is made to be interesting and helpful if one needs to do a case study or a qualitative  data analysis.

"Dr. Robert I. Kabacoff's R in Action has been my go-to R reference book since its first edition came out in 2011. I reviewed the second edition here on Amazon in 2015 and have been relying on that book since then. I have never used R frequently enough to get really good at it. Yet, when I do need to work with it, I have grabbed my now well-used copy of R in Action, Second Edition, and found the instructions and examples needed to complete my tasks. (It's still a good book for getting started with R, by the way.) That said, R in Action, Third Edition, is a real eye-opener for me. I didn't realize the program had gained so many enticing new features and capabilities over the past seven years. Kabacoff's updated book includes ""extensive coverage of tidyverse approaches to data management and analysis."" At least nine of the book's chapters and  three of its appendices have been expanded and updated. Some corrections and changes also have been made to examples and descriptions carried over from the second edition. In all, more than 200 pages of new material are presented. Some of the new sections include how to use RStudio ""for programming, debugging, report writing, and package creation..."" The package creation descriptions also cover ""how to share and promote your packages through CRAN, GitHub, and software-generated websites."" The latest edition is a hefty book, now nearly 600 pages in print form. Many of us today are dealing with new surges of data, and we need better ways to manipulate it, format it, display it, and manage it for the most efficient storage and retrieval. The tidyverse approach to data management and data analysis has its critics and its advocates. I don't know enough about it yet to render an opinion. But whether you are an R newcomer, an intermediate user, or someone who uses R extensively each day, you should consider having R in Action, Third Edition, within easy reach. You'll likely need it in the months and years ahead.My thanks to Manning Publications for sending a review copy.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"R in Action, Third Edition: Data analysis and graphics with R and Tidyverse"
"I bought the ebook directly from the publisher, Manning. I especially liked the examples and the practical approach. I have used and taught R for a number of years, and I found the examples useful and will be using some of them in class, too. However, I would not recommend this book for absolute beginners: the author has opted to base his exposition on RStudio, ggplot2 and ""Tidyverse"" packages like dplyr, instead of sticking to base R and introducing powerful high performing packages like data.table. I do not follow his reasoning (""most powerful and popular""), certainly not when it comes to learning R in the first place. Unfortunately, many authors rewrite their books because they feel that the ""Tidyverse"" and its approach is the way of the future. I have a more sceptical position towards these developments (please check out ""TidyverseSceptic"" on GitHub for more details). Hence, for beginners, I think the 2nd edition of this book is to be preferred over the 3rd edition. The 2nd edition is just brilliant, and I am glad that I obtained it from Manning for free when buying the 3rd edition. In practice, I often use the ""livebook"" version of the book (another innovation by Manning - see picture).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"R in Action, Third Edition: Data analysis and graphics with R and Tidyverse"

"As a Monty Python fan I've patiently waited for this movie to come to Blu-ray(2012) but didn't have very high expectations that it would look and sound all that good. Well I was wrong. It looks and sounds Great! And I'm not going to tell you it's an excellent movie, you already know that--great British humor(actually universal humor), ridiculously funny, great actors. And a silly price of only $9.99 (was $12.99 on release date).Sony did a 1080p transfer(1.66:1 original aspect ratio) of this movie that looks amazing! There's lots of strong detail in faces, clothes, as well as surroundings like buildings, grass, trees. Flesh and earth tones look very natural. Blacks are deep. Strong color is not going to jump out at you, but that's just the nature of the film as the outdoor setting of much of the movie's grass, dirt, and rocks(browns, blacks, grays & greens) never contained strong color elements. But what color there is (like in the tabards,coat of arms, shields) looks very good indeed. Is the movie without soft shots or grain? No, but they've brought out a whole lot of nicely rendered detail that makes the movie a joy to watch. Until now, I feel like I've only seen this movie through a fog. Well, the fog has finally lifted and everything looks sooo fresh.The audio is a lossless soundtrack (DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless). Voices sound very crisp and clear. Sound effects in general are very good. Audiofiles will notice some very rich sounding sections, but also some that are just acceptable. Overall, it is very enjoyable with nice use of surround sound and I think most people will be more than happy with it.LOTS OF EXTRAS: (Some New Stuff)Lost Animations (1080p, 12:55) Features Gilliam animations deleted from the film. ***New for this blu-ray release***Outtakes & Extended Scenes (1080p, 18:57)***New for this blu-ray release***MORE INCLUDED EXTRAS:(Some HD, some SD)Subtitles for People Who Do Not Like the Film (From Henry IV pt. 11).3 Mindless Sing-Alongs (480p, 5:10).How To Use Your Coconuts (An educational Film) (480p, 2:58)Quest for the Holy Grail Locations (480p, 47:00) Special DocumentaryCast Directory Photo Gallery (1080p).Lego Knights (480p, 1:43): A lego recreation of the ""Camelot's a silly place"" scene.Meanwhile, King Arthur & Sir Belvedere...Elephant & CastleRun Away!The Tale of Sir RobinThe Tale of Sir LancelotBBC Film NightRe-release TrailerThere are a couple more Commentaries, a Japanese version of 2 scenes(English subtitles), a UV Digital Copy and some credits AND the first subtitle from the opening credits that was missing on the Special Edition DVD is back.

"I'm new to Python.  This book clarified some fuzzy concepts, and it introduced me to several new concepts.Dan truly wants to help you become more proficient with Python.  Several times throughout the book, he uses phrases such as ""Think of it this way …"" or ""Another way to look at this is …"".  At the end of each chapter, he summarizes the ""Key Takeaways"".Dan recommends ""Best Practices"".  He mentions specific ways of doing things that (although not required) are the way that the Python community expects them to be done.I'm sure I'll be referring back to this book as I progress as a Python programmer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features
"I consider myself an 'early intermediate' Pythonista, with about three years of self-taught experience in the language, bolstered by all the good resources out there online. I first ran across Dan's page/blog through a Twitter link, I think, and have really enjoyed his Python Tricks emails. Some of them aren't news to me, but there have been multiple instances where they've given me a key insight into the behavior of Python, or an idea that's helped me improve my projects.As he notes in the Introduction, this book grew out of the Python Tricks emails, and it really shows. Dan has a knack for constructing code snippets that illustrate Python concepts in very few lines, and also for writing extremely clear descriptions of why they behave as they do. Further, even though Dan has years of Python experience, it seems clear to me he hasn't lost the sense of the ways in which Python can be confusing to new learners. I've only sampled here and there from his Buffet at this point, but have already gained two new concrete pieces of knowledge: bytearrays are mutable whereas bytes are not; and all it takes to create an abstract base class is to use metaclass=ABCMeta and decorate as needed with @abstractmethod. Even though I'd looked at the Python documentation for both of these before, I never quite understood either of them. But, Dan's phrasing and presentation made them crystal clear on my first read.One additional thing I like about the book is how Dan has included bits and pieces of his philosophy on Python, programming, writing good code, etc. Some people might be turned off by the editorializing, I suppose, but I really appreciate that the book provides these sorts of ""meta"" perspectives.All in all, an excellent resource for someone with modest to moderate Python experience looking to round out their knowledge of some of the more subtle features/behaviors of the language.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features
"The main reason why I bought the book is because I like Dan's blog.I consider my Python level to be intermediate. I have completed reading 100 pages(1/3 of the book). Although the content is decent, this feels like it is targeted more towards beginner(not an absolute beginner) than intermediate level. I am hardly learning anything new that is already not in Fluent Python (which is a big ass book in comparison but provides better understanding of the Pythonic tricks) or in Raymond Hettinger or David Beazley’s videos on YouTube.I will update the review once I finish reading the entire book.Update: I finished reading the book and I still stand by what I said earlier. If you have time and patience, go with Fluent python. Other than the new style string formatting, rest of the content is mostly covered in that.That does not mean this is not a good book. I really loved some of the chapters like generators, iterators. The examples were more simple and easy to understand. Overall, I found this book to be more of a tutorial than a reference material. Mainly because I use the excellent pymotw website for the Collections part of the book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features

Good book material quality and size (small but also perfect thickness to carry around).2. Great and interesting topics with intermediate+ level examples.3. Concepts were very well described.Cons:1. Books lacks colors, It seems like HTMl version of this must have used some Markdown but the book is just plain black/white texts.2. Wish there were some more examples per topics.3. Chapters/Topics are short enough that *key takeaways* section can seem bit redundant.

"Many of the topics in the book were presented in a  straightforward manner. It's fun to sort of get lost in the concepts. I feel that there was a need for some practical use cases that the average person?.. No, novice programmer can intuit.

It made me interested in the communities he mentions at the end of the book which seem like viable resources for someone at that novice level interested in progressing this skill set at their own pace.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features
"I'm an advanced python user and have worked at several startups, Google, and Microsoft, but I still found several tips in here that were new to me, and many others that I only knew because I'd learned them from colleagues when I worked at Google. For instance, I would usually just define an __str__ method on my custom classes and be lazy and not implement __repr__. But the book points out that if you want be lazy, just define __repr__ alone, as the default behavior of __str__ will call your __repr__ function anyway. I should have known this already but somehow it's a little thing I had missed when learning python. There are lots of bits of info like this: some you'll probably already know, but you might be surprised by a couple little tricks.One outstanding feature of the book is a short recap after each section, giving simple rules of thumb to to follow. This cleared up a lot of uncertainty for me about some python best practices. I really like the book ""Fluent Python"" as well, but this one has more simple and practical suggestions and was a very quick read.Highly recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features

I have always been amazed by students or colleagues who seem to have this uncanny ability to ""master"" a language like Python.  I have purchased many Python books over the years but none of them really felt like the fit.  This one does.  I feel this book will take from up from beginning (functions, for loops, arrays, conditionals) to a more advanced programming using programming constructs beyond the basics.

An excellent film. Don't know what to say that other people have already said. Pretty old movie but still holds up. First saw it as a teenager back in the early 2000s. Never had a copy of my own but the blu-ray version is very good. No complaints with the quality or anything and I feel the transfer was done just fine.

"As a Monty Python fan I've patiently waited for this movie to come to Blu-ray(2012) but didn't have very high expectations that it would look and sound all that good. Well I was wrong. It looks and sounds Great! And I'm not going to tell you it's an excellent movie, you already know that--great British humor(actually universal humor), ridiculously funny, great actors. And a silly price of only $9.99 (was $12.99 on release date).Sony did a 1080p transfer(1.66:1 original aspect ratio) of this movie that looks amazing! There's lots of strong detail in faces, clothes, as well as surroundings like buildings, grass, trees. Flesh and earth tones look very natural. Blacks are deep. Strong color is not going to jump out at you, but that's just the nature of the film as the outdoor setting of much of the movie's grass, dirt, and rocks(browns, blacks, grays & greens) never contained strong color elements. But what color there is (like in the tabards,coat of arms, shields) looks very good indeed. Is the movie without soft shots or grain? No, but they've brought out a whole lot of nicely rendered detail that makes the movie a joy to watch. Until now, I feel like I've only seen this movie through a fog. Well, the fog has finally lifted and everything looks sooo fresh.The audio is a lossless soundtrack (DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless). Voices sound very crisp and clear. Sound effects in general are very good. Audiofiles will notice some very rich sounding sections, but also some that are just acceptable. Overall, it is very enjoyable with nice use of surround sound and I think most people will be more than happy with it.LOTS OF EXTRAS: (Some New Stuff)Lost Animations (1080p, 12:55) Features Gilliam animations deleted from the film. ***New for this blu-ray release***Outtakes & Extended Scenes (1080p, 18:57)***New for this blu-ray release***MORE INCLUDED EXTRAS:(Some HD, some SD)Subtitles for People Who Do Not Like the Film (From Henry IV pt. 11).3 Mindless Sing-Alongs (480p, 5:10).How To Use Your Coconuts (An educational Film) (480p, 2:58)Quest for the Holy Grail Locations (480p, 47:00) Special DocumentaryCast Directory Photo Gallery (1080p).Lego Knights (480p, 1:43): A lego recreation of the ""Camelot's a silly place"" scene.Meanwhile, King Arthur & Sir Belvedere...Elephant & CastleRun Away!The Tale of Sir RobinThe Tale of Sir LancelotBBC Film NightRe-release TrailerThere are a couple more Commentaries, a Japanese version of 2 scenes(English subtitles), a UV Digital Copy and some credits AND the first subtitle from the opening credits that was missing on the Special Edition DVD is back.

"I averaged the rating over the two editions, as the first went far beyond expectations, categorized as a 'must have' for beginners, and is still the best book I would recommend to all newbies.The first ed of this book was a game changer for an experienced data scientist with non-CS/data structures training/orientation, transitioning from other languages to Python. Having advanced ML programming experience from training in Stats, Econ and Math I tried many authors to switch, finally found traction for the first time with Python by using the first edition this book.Numpy, multi-dimensional arrays, Pandas are beautifully explained, clear conceptualization. As is scikit-learn.So why the three stars?Tensor Flow was gaining traction when the first ed and I eagerly waited for 2nd ed from this brilliant author. And after almost a decade of advancement I expected many new features and Python modules would be added.I was shocked and seriously disappointed to find no difference between the two editions. The main difference is cosmetic - chapters in the first are broken down and referred to as sections in the second, each header in the first are now separate chapters. No tensor flow or NLP or even locational analytics added. The content is shockingly the same. What is telling is there is no explanation on the difference between the two editions. Contrast this with Geron's second edition which came out three years earlier, and added Tensor Flow.Save your $. I am adding this review as the first edition was hugely discounted in Amazon, I find that today its priced the same as the second. I would wait for the price of the second ed to reduce.

"This is IMO the best advanced book on Python.  I read the first edition five years ago or so - 900 pages - and am now working the through the second edition - 1500 pages.  This book is not for the casual Python programmer, however.  I have been writing Python code for more than twenty years, but I learn new things or sharpen my knowledge with every chapter.  The coverage is comprehensive; the writing is very clear, and the example code is carefully annotated.I had been eagerly awaiting this new edition, which is a year or two late from the original publication date, but I am very disappointed with the Kindle version, which was fine in the first edition.  While the Kindle app on my pc works fine, it does not work on my iPad, which has plenty of free memory.  After just ten pages or so, the app freezes, and I cannot get any further.  I cannot even jump to later points in the book.The publisher, O'Reilly, refuses to take any responsibility for this.

"First of all, as to the content of the book: This is THE best book on Python in my opinion. It's the way to understand how Python works so that you can dance with it, not just sit on the sidelines wondering why things are the way they are. Get it, read it, and you WILL know Python at a much more substantive level than most Python programmers who have not read this.Many people (including the author) may warn you that this is an ""advanced book"" or that it focuses on the obscure topic of metaprogramming with __dunder__() methods in Python, but it turns out that the way it explains Python using these things ends up teaching you just exactly what you need to know to use the language effectively. It's (probably) not a book for a beginning programmer who needs humor and cartoons to keep them awake, but for anyone with a technical orientation who wants to just be told how things work, this is the best book you could ask for. It does not tell you anything you do not need to know.My advice for intelligent, motivated, technical people (like you I suspect) who want to learn Python is to first go through the official Python Tutorial (on the official Python website) if you need an introduction to the features of the language and then read this book from cover to cover.It's just a great book.Now a note on the production of this edition by O'Rielly: I was disappointed that they didn't do a nicer job with the production and printing of the 2nd edition. It's printed in monochrome on heavy paper which makes the physical book a serious tome at around 1,000 pages. For the price they're asking I was hoping to see something like the quality of their ""Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems 2nd Edition"" which is printed on thinner, higher-quality paper, in full color, and the paper flows and feels great in your hand and even though it's a big book it's really nice to own in that form. For Fluent Python, I recommend reading it in one of the electronic formats like Kindle or O'Reilly Learning, or I believe there's a source for an official purchasable PDF version that the author Tweeted about a while back. I have not seen the Kindle version myself, but I was very happy with the O'Reilly Learning online version and I presume the Kindle experience should be similar.In any case, it gets all the stars, and you should own a copy in some medium.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming"

Now considering myself a relative beginner I did a bit of research looking at free online courses and texts on the topic. This book got great reviews, so I decided to give it a go. I'm a bit disappointed.I'm not often bothered by the odd typo, but this books contains loads. For example: Wrong information given ('/' printed instead of '\'); missing figures are referenced, etc. If you are trying to learn something that is quite precise from scratch it's important to do it with accuracy.I would not recommend this book to anyone who has experience with another programming language (even from 20 years ago). If you don't have any experience at all then some of the examples and diagrams given are quite good and will help you understand basic programming concepts. I read through the book in just a few hours and really didn't learn anything other than Python has some quite powerful string operators (in the form of functions) built and a refresher on object oriented programming. Again, the last chapter has entire half page of code missing!if you are a complete novice to programming and you can find your way past the typos,, missing text, and the odd piece of misinformation, then you will find this book useful.It may be important to note I have the kindle version.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Python Programming For Beginners: The Ultimate Crash Course to Learn Python Coding Quickly and Easily | Step-by-Step Guide With Hands-on Exercises & Beginners Projects

"I freely admit I bought this movie knowing how bad it was, and for David Hewlett. I've adored him for years now.The plot without giving anything away, involves a millionaire with a reputation for finding rare or somehow altered animals (bigger is better!) and creating a semi-controlled hunt for them involving other rich folks with too much money and time on their hands. Our villain Broddick (Adam Kendrick) gets a hold of a giant python intending it for one of his hunts and things naturally don't go as planned.On the other side we have our heroes, Monica a plucky marine biologist (Jamie Bergman) whose developing sensors for dolphins as the navy uses them in dives, in hopes of mapping both the environment the sensors are in, and all that can be seen in it it's field. Joining her is Dr. Emmett (the always fantasticDavid Hewlett) a reptile and snake expert whose own specific research involves Betty, a giant genetically enhanced scarlet boa whose been bred in hopes of creating a universal anti-venom.When the python gets loose, as giant big damn snakes tend to do, and Samuel L. Jackson isn't around, the government in the form of Agent Sharp (Kirk B. R. Woller) decides to try and let the giant boa take it on and you have your standard cable movie creature feature plot.What makes this one different is that it manages to walk the line very carefully between being too silly or tongue in cheek, and taking itself way too seriously. The script is several notches above several of the large beast vs large beast movies of the last decade and the cast is too.Make no mistakes, a great movie that will be long remembered, this is not. There are naturally a few cringe worthy lines and wooden performances, but for an enjoyable ""bad"" movie with a ridiculous premise, a decent amount of laughs and action, Boa vs Python isn't a bad way to spend a Saturday. And if creature flicks are your thing, I think you'll enjoy it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Boa Vs. Python
"I orginally saw this movie on the Sci-fy Channel.  At the time I thought it was better than most of their movies which isn't saying a lot as most if their stuff is drek.  Upon watching the streamed movie from Amazon, I was struck by the poor special effects and the lack of screen time for the giant snakes.  Still, it is better than most of the sci-fi/horror movies I have streamed recently.  My 4 star review is based on that comparison.  Just as a movie this thing is 3 or maybe even 2 stars.  If you are starved for monster movies you may want to try this.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Boa Vs. Python
"This is about a big game hunter who arranges to have a giant boa (or maybe it's the python) flown in so that he and his fellow hunters can have some fun going after it.  But it escapes and gets down into the sewer system.  Some government people just happen to have an equally huge python (or maybe it's the boa), so naturaly they decide to release the second snake to hunt down the first.  Sounds like a fine idea to me.Fairly average B movie.  I've only seen the edited for TV version, but it looked like the unedited version might have some T&A.  The characters are average, acting was average (for a B movie), the action was pretty slow.  The snakes are so obviously CGI that watching them fight is more like a video game than a movie.  Really no suspense, and when the snakes attack, since they're put in afterwards via computer animation, the actors don't really seem to react to them.  That pretty much kills any excitement.  The movie doesn't take itself very seriously, and it is somewhat funny in parts.  There's a pretty girl in it, which is the only reason I sat through the whole thing.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Boa Vs.

"The filmmakers took a supposedly `humorous' approach to this film, assuming that if they didn't take it seriously no one else would (?).  The plot involves a millionaire wacko (Adam Kendrick as Broddick) who decides to invite a crackpot team of nitwits to hunt a BIG snake he just happens to have for just such an occasion.  Needless to say, said snake escapes requiring several groups to track and kill it.  Enter the FBI as one such contingent.  They play it smart by turning to an expert to help them pursue this snake.  Fortunately, herpetologist Dr. Emmett (David Hewlett) is available and he teams up with a marine biologist (Jaime Bergman) to use his GIANT snake as a bloodhound of sorts (because apparently everyone in this movie just happens to have a HUGE snake when one is required!?).  It is a weird premise that also demands full nudity because nothing screams horror movie like a woman taking a bath on a plane!!!I can't say that it looks as though a lot of effort and care when into the making of this movie.  It was obviously made to cash in on a trend.  That it failed to meet anyone's standard for excellence is apparent in the results.  Still, it was entertaining enough that I decided to keep it for future viewings.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Boa Vs. Python
"Where to begin.  It is a low budget B movie, with terrible special effects.  The acting is only so-so, and the script is poor.  It is difficult to know if the movie was meant to be serious or simply high camp.  It is more campy.  But not that good for a genuinely campy movie.  They throw in a lot of stereotypes.  There is the TV reporter that seeks to make it big with a blockbuster report.  There are some real Yahoos among the hunting party.  And Agent Sharpe is the no nonsense FBI agent.  And there are so many unforced plot flaws.  It was referenced in the heat of the sun, the snake would seek out the coolest spot.  It is a reptile, and they seek warm places.  A lot of the movie takes place in what is supposed to a water treatment plant for Philadelphia, and when the snake gets into it, water is shutoff for the entire city.  None of that makes sense with the piping and the steam and pulses of steam.  And besides, that is not how Philadelphia gets and treats its water.  And they throw in a snake in heat, with amorous intent with the other snake.  To give more realism, the vehicles have Pennsylvania license plates, but on the front bumper.  Pennsylvania utilizes a single plate on the rear of the car.  But then it was filmed in Bulgaria.  They do throw in nudity.  A bathing scene aboard a 747 plane in the first 12 minutes of the film, quite revealing, and topless dancers near the end of the film.  The movie is simply a mess.  I had hope near the beginning that the film aimed for high comedy.  It might have been better if they had been able to keep on that track.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Boa Vs. Python

The author shows you the relevant equations, there is usually an illustration, and then he shows you how to perform the function in Python with lots of explanation. There are also several illustrations of how to use a concept in linear algebra to perform a certain task, such as image processing. I highly recommend this book.

"This is the fourth game-oriented Python book I've purchased to help my kids learn coding skills. So far, I think this one is my favorite book for graphical gaming titles. I purchased the paperback version; it's over 200 pages, and each page is full of practical skills and helpful teaching. Every chapter tackles a different game and breaks down exactly what's going on and how to apply the programming concepts that the authors are teaching you. After two necessary intro chapters on getting a very beginner-level knowledge of Python, you're then provided 9 chapters that help you build increasingly sophisticated and fun games.  We actually enjoy playing these games because they have the right mixture of low-res (retro) graphics and simple interactivity.==Who is this book for? ==Parents with kids as young as 7 or 8 can help their little ones begin a real programming language. You don't need pseudo-coding or fancy robots to learn to code--just this book and a free copy of Python will do the trick. You can even use the $35 Raspberry Pi as your computer if you have a TV and a keyboard lying around. For older kids in their tweens or early teens, this book will be all they need, even with no help from adults.==How is Coding Games in Python different?==This book is a great balance of depth and fun. There isn't nearly as much theory and explanation as the excellent titles by Al Sweigart have, but this book does provide enough detail and troubleshooting advice to help you glimpse what's going on under the hood. The authors even teach you to use a graphical module called Pygame Zero, which is a lightweight way to start coding games with graphics. It's also a great introduction to the full-blown Pygame later on.==Any Downsides to this book?==This isn't a substitute for a real computer science class. I felt that Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python (by Sweigart) introduced you to most of the concepts and theory to succeed in a high school level computer science curriculum. Instead, this book focused on getting plenty of experience, even if that means that your kid doesn't necessarily know everything that's going on with the code. I feel like parents that already know Python will be able to use this book as a hook to get kids interested and will be able to explain the areas that the book only glosses over.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Coding Games in Python (Computer Coding for Kids)
"My 7 year old wants to be a computer game designer. She's messed around with Scratch a bit, but I wanted to introduce her to a text based programming language. She's still having some trouble grasping the concepts, but I think this book is about as simple as Python can be made for a kid. And they'll start programming video games almost right away (really after the first chapter). I've never used Pygame before, so I didn't realize how simple the games could be. The exercises provided in this book are really perfect and progressive from one to the next. Probably the only thing I'd ask for is some kind of online counterpart with videos they could watch about concepts like loops, functions, and variables where my kid seems to go through the motions just fine but I'm not convinced that she actually ""gets"" it.To be fair, my daughter is a little young for this.

"This book is a textbook case (hah!) of truth in advertising. It’s directed at people who are interested in using Python as a tool primarily for data analysis, rather than people who are interested in learning Python for more general programming purposes. Is it effective? Yes and no. The early parts of the book are quite instructive, covering the basics of Python’s built-in types and syntax, and building to greater complexity. At some point, though, the bottom suddenly falls out. The difficulty ramps up tremendously, and the book largely devolves into massive code dumps, or links to massive code dumps, with most of the discussion focused on how to make use of the programs rather than how to develop similar programs for your own purposes. I have a feeling that in a classroom setting, with supplemental materials and a good teacher, this is likely less of an issue.All in all, it’s a fine book, and well-targeted. I really appreciated the section on regular expressions, which is a topic most introductory programming texts don’t even mention, and the database interactions are another oft-neglected area that had some good, basic information. I think it would benefit from a bit more dissection of the later programs, but for the price I can’t really complain. 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3

I'm using this book in tandem with the coursera.org course on the same called python for everybody and this is invaluable to the course. This book teaches python coding and not - as many many other beginner coding courses teach - how to solve math questions. By the time I got to chapter 10 I was comfortable reading and understanding just about every line of code I came across at the beginner to slightly more advanced data structures level. I can't say I liked the book on kindle though as I used kindle on my phone and it was a bit of a pita to use. I ended up downloading the free pdf and found that did me better than the way it's formatted for kindle.

"This book is not intended for professional programmers, and that's a very good thing for the rest of us. His primary motivation is to help readers understand how large amounts of data and information can be readily analyzed using Python. Another good point - he tells us that Python vocabulary is a rather small set of 'reserved words' with special meaning to Python. Unlike English, there is no ambiguity about what these words mean in Python.Severance then describes how to start a conversation with Python - after first installing the Python software on your computer. Much/most of that information is offline, accessible through a link he provides. Continuing, >>> is Python's way of asking 'What do you want me to do next?' and the need for parentheses surround the description of what you want your computer to do. Python, like other programming languages, is very picky about syntax.Then on to labeling/describing data to be used.

"The simplest and clearest explanations out of nearly a dozen introductory python texts I have collected. Artfully crafted instructional progression with by far the most relevant and amusing analogies and example cases. It is interesting to note that this is basically the third formal edition of a constantly improving open-source resource that was initially restructured and reworked by a very gifted teacher to teach data analysis and data mining; if you have tried to work through Think Python you should be able to recognize the refinement resulting from the writer's having used previous editions of this text to teach tens of thousands of students.  I keep going back to this book as a reference as well. It really does contain the concisest explanations, and I am recognizing more and more that the code blocks and larger processing methods he describes are paragons of industry approaches. Starting here will make your life so much simpler and your learning immediately so much more productive: you won't get lost in all the technical asides and theoretical maelstroms so many datascience Python texts seem to love to spin into and through.

What I noticed is that this book could be a good book for beginners, if you're not new to programming. There's nothing you cannot do.

"One of the best books I've read on programming so far. It's well written, easy to understand, very affordable, and there are some extra resources available to you as well, which I found really useful.The only caveat I would give is that this may not be the best choice for the math-averse, as many of the exercises involve dealing with math problems. I would not consider myself particularly mathematically inclined and can still get through them with some effort, and enjoy the challenge of learning something new and putting some long-unused brain cells to work, but it may be frustrating if you really hate math. There is always the option to skip exercises you don't like, of course.I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in programming, or wanting to learn Python, beginners included.

"I've read a few books from O'Reilly in that past and have generally enjoyed them. What I expected in this case was a thorough introduction to some of the core Python packages for algorithmic trading and a rundown of how the author thinks they should be integrated into a larger trading system. I was a disappointed to find only a short discussion of the capabilities of the oanda and FXCM packages and thought the authors suggested trading system to be, at times, contradictory.Also, given the wealth of prediction algorithms available in Python, I expected a more systematic review of such algorithms and some associated insights. However, only a handfull of algorithms were up for discussion and let's just say that they left a lot to the imagination. The discussion of backtesting was also largely simplified and ignored many of the real-world practicalities that have the potential to adversely affect the outcome.The lack of quality editing is glaringly obvious. The structure of the chapters changes around quite frequently. Some have an introduction, some don't. Some have discussions after testing concepts, some dont. And some are mainly just code and output. Also, many figures are illegible and typos are quite common.

"While I realize this is not a strictly ""beginner"" guide to python, the second chapter is very confusing for someone looking to refresh their memory. There are several examples in natural language processing that suddenly whip out coding concepts and ideas that are not explained or introduced. It's hard to tell if the author is just showing you what you can do when the concepts in the book and will teach you the details later or if you're supposed to fully grasp things later on. For example, the basics of what lists are is explained, but then list comprehensions get whipped out of nowhere with no explanation- a much harder concept for a beginner. And similarly, when you hit dictionaries in the next section a lambda function gets whipped out with no explanation other than that this magical sequence of commands does something. No explanation of what, exactly, that lambda thing does. It's a bit overwhelming to a person who is just starting out in their second foray into python.As I move through, chapter 3 was smooth, but chapter 4 on data opening was a mess. Even copy pasting code out of their github gave all manner of errors. There is also a spot where it pings a github URL and it's just utterly broken, giving over 1500 lines in response. It's just so sloppily written...Moving further in the book, it does improve a bit, though at times it feels more like I'm copy pasting code and just running it instead of understanding what is being done by certain commands, which are sometimes whipped out of thin air.Chapter 12 is also a big mess. It tells you to scrape amazon reviews with a particular tool, but the features of the tool are now behind a paywall, otherwise you can't see the key dependent variable. It also askes you to use google-translate-new, but that wasn't working either anymore, you had to use a different plugin.A bigger issue I have with this book, though, is that it somewhat bizarrely omits much discussion of dealing with real data with common statistical techniques. How do you detect and handle missing data? It really isn't addressed. How do you run a regression model or ANOVA or T-test? No clue. It's strange that the book is clearly built with the intention of using statistical techniques, but the basic repertoire of essential econometrics techniques are all but ignored. It's really to the detriment, too. In chapter 10, you've got data on stock prices and volume. The technique used to determine if there is a correlation between past volume and future prices is to compare averages between two groups (ok), but then it goes on to have you do another exercise where you're literally just eyeballing a pile of data to see if there is a difference. This would have been a perfect spot to do something like a regression of the lagged data onto the future stocks. Cmon!Of course, in the last machine learning chapter, you actually do that idea of predicting things with lags in a ML model. But...the book ends on this model and, hilariously, it doesn't show you any diagnostics that they previously taught you to use. I wonder why? Oh, it's because the moment you do Sklearn starts throwing errors because the model literally only predicts 0's, not -1 or 1 like anticipated. The model presented in the book is both broken and comically misleading to the point of being a waste of the reader's time.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Data Science: A Hands-On Introduction

"Last year I started my first project assignment on deep learning, and puzzled my way through it using Stack Overflow. It was a disjointed and somewhat awkward way to learn, but I did in fact get a lot of the basics. However, when I saw this book I suddenly realized it was past time to do some proper reading and learning on the topic, and fired off an order. Reading it now gives a series of 'oh yeah', and 'aha' moments, as it connects up various loose ends I'd come across and never properly registered. It's written in a semi-conversational style that is similar to how you'd get information from a co-worker, if you had a co-worker that was knowledgeable in deep learning. For example, it has a style where there's an occasional contra-example given to show what something ISN'T, alongside what it IS. I didn't have any such co-worker, but if I'd had this book instead of just stack overflow it would have been a big help. Highly recommended if your learning style is anecdotal, informal and driven by hands-on results.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Deep Learning: A Python-Based Introduction

"I read Murach's Python for Data Analysis because I work with database administration and data analysis. I am trying to learn more about using about tools to perform the analysis and Python is being used many shops. I had previously used Spyder as a Python IDE, but was not aware of using Juypter Lab as an IDE. Section 2 was entitled “The critical skills for success on the job” and had chapters on obtaining data, cleaning it, preparing it and then analyzing the data. There was information in the chapters that was good for all levels of professionals from beginners to intermediate levels. The explanations of working with Data Frames and JSON data was very helpful. Cleaning data is one of the trickiest parts of data science and there is a chapter on that subject that covers many different data issues including missing data and invalid values. In the analysis sections of the book, you will see how to use regular Python code. You will also get a good introduction to using Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Seaborn libraries. I have worked with linear regression in R and was interested to see how to do the analysis with Python. Chapter 10 dives into this subject and gives thorough coverage of it. Chapter 11 works with multiple regression models which is a fairly advanced and useful technique. Section 4 contains four different cases studies, one per chapter. Each case study is very thorough and gives the readers a lot of details and shows how Python is used in the cases.There are appendices of the book for Windows and MacOS that show how to set up an Anaconda environment so you can work with Python including the Spyder and Juypter “tools”.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Murach's Python for Data Analysis (Training & Reference)
"I’ve been looking for a book like Murach’s Python for Data Analysis for a long time, and I was delighted to find that one had been recently published.  What sets the book apart from other books that I’ve found on data analysis with Python is that Python for Data Analysis covers all aspects of the process.  It’s a thorough book on how to download data from websites into python and how to visualize the data in a tabular display or graphical using typical add-on libraries such a Panda and Seaborn.  Unlike some other books on data analysis with Python, the explanations of how to perform data analysis are thorough rather than terse or with no explanations.The book also shows the use of the Python development interface Juypter Notebooks, which allows you to execute Python statements individually without the use of a debugger, so it’s a simple way to work through the examples one at a time.  You can download all of the examples in the book from the publisher’s website along with additional exercises and solutions.Lastly, there are several case studies so you can practice a complete project and compare to the case study solutions that are also provided.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Murach's Python for Data Analysis (Training & Reference)

I really enjoyed this book as a result: short, clear, practical lessons, light on the theory, and aimed at making code better.I’m not convinced that reading this e.g. gave me a coherent and complete philosophy around code that I expect some other books would, but the fact that I finished this one, and it’ll almost certainly make my python better, means it was more useful.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Robust Python: Write Clean and Maintainable Code

The book is well organized to delineate different components of Spark, e.g. intro, structured api, streaming, optimizations, data lake, ml deployment options. While ML deployment needs for individual business use cases are highly specific, I find the overview deployment framework provided by the book to be helpful. I also liked that the book uses screenshots of Spark UI and arrows to point in the screenshots to explain the UI, since the UI can be hard to understand. The code samples and the graphics in other sections are useful as well. There’s also coverage on how to connect to different apps, like beeline (which I’ve never heard of), tableau, thrift.

"I'm a software engineer who knows his way through SQL, mostly running queries/transforms on Postgres and Redshift. The majority of my background is in building and supporting services. Having no background knowledge in Spark, I was looking for a book that explains the fundamental concepts, helps me get up running, and helps me expand my toolkit for working with ""big data"".I was able to follow along in this book fairly easily. Working on a MacBook, I did have to first install Scala, download Spark, enable Spark in IntelliJ, etc. I didn't have trouble with this as it was fairly straightforward. With my environment set up, I found the book presents every code sample in Scala and Python. I worked through the code samples, chapter by chapter, writing Scala in IntelliJ or sometimes writing Scala in the Spark CLI itself.I did take a detour from the book slightly to learn a bit more about sbt, which is the Scala build tool.For a beginner such as myself, this book is a God send, but I do wish the authors approached some things differently.In my opinion, some topics are covered in a very ""hand-wavy"" manner. For example, Chapter 4 discusses managed vs. unmanaged tables. While knowing this difference exists is helpful for the reader, the authors never discuss when you should use a managed table or an unmanaged table. They could have included that information or pointed the user to some external source. This part of Chapter 4 then shows sample code on how to create a managed table from a CSV file. However, it's not clear what should I do with that information. What are the patterns applicable to a managed table vs. unmanaged table? What are the trade-offs? Being a beginner book, I still feel the authors could have written even just 1 page, which would add significant value to this section.Sometimes the book will share some interesting tidbit but using terminology or concepts that the authors haven't really described. I found this very frustrating. For example:> (Chapter 4, page 92) ... you can create multiple SparkSessions within a single Spark application—this can be handy, for example, in cases where you want to access (and combine) data from two different SparkSessions that don’t share the same Hive metastore configurations.If you search for mentions Hive, you see the authors briefly mentioned Spark uses a Hive metastore to persist table metadata. So are the authors saying I can use one Spark installation and access table metadata from different Hive metastores? Why would I ever want to access only the metadata for different tables? Again – the use case isn't clear.As a beginner, I found this book very valuable, and I believe it is a great investment.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Data Analytics
"The foreword and preface to this book comment that an update to the first edition, published in 2015, was long overdue. After all, the first edition makes use of Apache Spark 1.3.0, whereas this update makes use of Apache Spark 3.0.0-preview2 (the latest version available at the time of writing). For the most part, I successfully ran all notebook code out of the box using Databricks Runtime 7.6 ML (includes Apache Spark 3.0.1, Scala 2.12), albeit minor issues are explained later in this review alongside my resolutions to these. I was, however, able to successfully run all standalone PySpark applications from chapters #2 and #3 out of the box using Apache Spark 3.0.1 and Python 3.7.9. As explained, the approach used here is intended to be conductive to hands-on learning, but with a focus on Spark's Structured APIs, so there are a few topics that aren't covered, such as the following: the older low-level Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) APIs, GraphX (Spark's API for graphs and graph-parallel computation), how to extend Spark's Catalyst optimizer, how to implement your own catalog, and how to write your own DataSource V2 data sinks and sources.Content is broken down into 12 chapters: (1) ""Introduction to Apache Spark: A Unified Analytics Engine"", (2) ""Downloading Apache Spark and Getting Started"", (3) ""Apache Spark's Structured APIs"", (4) ""Spark SQL and DataFrames: Introduction to Built-in Data Sources"", (5) ""Spark SQL and DataFrames: Interacting with External Data Sources"", (6) ""Spark SL and Datasets"", (7) ""Optimizing and Tuning Spark Applications"", (8) ""Structured Streaming"", (9) ""Building Reliable Data Lakes with Apache Spark"", (10) ""Machine Learning with MLlib"", (11) ""Managing, Deploying, and Scaling Machine Learning Pipelines with Apache Spark"", and (12) ""Epilogue: Apache Spark 3.0"". The longest chapter is chapter #8, followed closely behind by chapters #3, #4, #5, and #10, and the most notebooks are provided for chapters #10 and #11, although this is largely due to individual notebooks dedicated to a variety of topics. This book is the fourth of four related books I've worked through, a couple years after the earlier three: ""Spark: The Definitive Guide"" (2018), ""High Performance Spark: Best Practices for Scaling and Optimizing Apache Spark"" (2017), and ""Practical Hive: A Guide to Hadoop's Data Warehouse System"" (2016). As I mentioned in an earlier review, if you are new to Apache Spark, these four texts will help enable your going in the right direction, although keep in mind that the related tech stack is evolving and you will obviously need to supplement this material with web documentation and developer forums, as well as to get hands-on with the tooling. Reading the earlier three books in opposite order of publication date enabled exposure to more current material sooner rather than later, but this was largely just a coincidence. Now that this new book is available, I recommend working through this one first. While I wouldn't discount ""Spark: The Definitive Guide"", because it provides content not in this new book and I personally think it flows better, use it very judiciously because it was created using the Spark 2.0.1 APIs.The only notebooks I wasn't able to successfully run out of the box are constrained to chapter #11. In notebook 11-3 (""Distributed Inference""), 11-5 (""Joblib""), and 11-7 (""Koalas""), FileNotFoundErrors were generated when attempting to use Pandas to read from CSV or Parquet files using ""read_csv()"" and ""read_parquet()"", respectively. In taking a look at what the community had to say, I discovered that this is a known issue, so I replaced these Pandas statements with ""spark.read.option(...).csv(""..."") and ""spark.read.option(...).parquet(""..."") instead, respectively, subsequently converting to Pandas using ""toPandas()"". In looking at the documentation, Pandas 1.0.1 is installed on both the CPU and GPU clusters for the aforementioned Databricks Runtime (the latest non-beta currently available). In notebook 11-3 (""Distributed Inference""), the following PythonException was generated when attempting to execute a ""mapInPandas()"" statement that uses a mix of numeric data types in the schema argument: ""pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert 3.0 with type str: tried to convert to double"". In the absence of decent community guidance, and because this statement is solely used for display purposes, I simply converted all of these data types to ""STRING"". According to the documentation, Pyarrow 1.0.1 is installed on both the CPU and GPU clusters for the aforementioned Databricks Runtime. I personally got the most value out of chapters #7 and #8. Chapter #7 covers optimizing and tuning Spark for efficiency, caching and persistence of data, Spark joins, and inspecting the Spark UI. Chapter #8 covers evolution of the Apache Spark stream processing engine, the programming model of Structured Streaming, the fundamentals of a Structured Streaming query, streaming data sources and sinks, data transformations, stateful streaming aggregations, streaming joins, arbitrary stateful computations, and performance tuning. In particular, I especially appreciated the sections on the two most common Spark join strategies (the broadcast hash join and shuffle sort merge join), the Spark UI, stateful streaming aggregations, and streaming joins.

"Pros:- Doesn't bog you down with the details of how many of these algorithms work.- The book provides high level overviews of what various libraries will for you.Cons:- The book builds on itself, so it does not function at all as a reference. The authors have deliberately used OOP methods to create their own classes inheriting functionality from various ML libraries.- Because of the above, you can't skip forward to a section on topic modeling for example, because there are about 500 lines worth of code that you have to define in order to make use of the functions listed around page 100 (as an example.)-It's hard to tell what each line of code is doing if you're not already very experienced with python. The authors do not explain classes, methods, inheritance or polymorphism, let alone simpler topics like list comprehensions to the reader.Bottom line, it's a very informative read, but it is not very plug & play. You have to be committed to doing things their way or else you won't be able to use code later supplied. The authors are kind enough to list the page numbers where a given function was previously delineated, but keep in mind, you're both learning how established NLP libraries work, as well as how the authors think you should blend them together into complex objects.However, if you'd like to understand less about how these APIs work and more about how they can ""connect"" with one another in depth, this book is for you. Just be mindful that this book requires a lot of effort up front, and if that's not you, then you probably won't get maximum value out of it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Applied Text Analysis with Python: Enabling Language-Aware Data Products with Machine Learning
"In a hot summer evening when I did book browsing at Barnes and Noble, I found this book and immediately liked it. Due to the relative large price difference, I did not bought it at the bookstore but ordered a copy from Amazon. I am a mathematician and semi-physicist by training and data scientist by vocation, and I never enjoy reading technical books except when I have to for work-related studies (I enjoy theoretical books such as Lectures on Quantum Mechanics or Group Theory in a Nutshell for Physicists or etc.) But let me say I do enjoy reading this book.  This book gives a very good introduction to fundamental concepts of natural language processing (NLP) as well as a survey of current NLP landscape (formulations, NLP libraries, applications, etc.). It is also hands-on. Good books of such kind should never be too long (A long book usu. = collection of stuff you can find by Googling). I am glad this book is not too long (300-ish  pages), so you can read end to end and not miss every single idea of the authors'.

"I’d put myself more in the realm of domain specialist with an interest of how text mining tools could be practically leveraged.  The alphabet soup of frameworks and models to text minimum can be confounding.... as unstructured text tends to be for us looking for clearer insights.The authors do an great job of taking you through key concepts and applications, all anchored in Python code (and later some examples from Spark environments).  While the code does require some attention to work through if you are not primarily a programmer, they are worth pondering over.To get the full value out of the book, its most worth working live through some of the sample code and libraries.  Many of you (as I was) probably will not be able to do this in the first run.

"This is a great reference book filled with many helpful code snippets. There are many insightful hints and tricks in the book, things I did not know even though I have used Python and Pandas for a while. I have read and owned many Time Series Analysis/Forecasting textbooks, mostly filled with R code, making it hard to transition or translate these concepts into Python. There are few Python Time Series books out there, these are great resources to understand the concepts within Time Series Analysis/Forecasting, but they lack proper code implementation (and explanations) to show how things work and the best way to implement them. I think this cookbook fills that gap between the different academic textbooks so you can feel comfortable in developing solutions that can be used in a real-world setting. It takes you from theory to hands-on implementation and many valuable hints to take things further.I liked the balance between ML, DL, and Statistical Methods, but also a fair amount of Data Engineering (how to read/write to Snowflake, AWS Redshift, InfluxDB, Cloud storage, and working with SAS files ..etc.). As a reference book, I find that it can be very beneficial for me in the future as it covers a wide range of topics, the entire end-to-end process, from data pipeline, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preparation for ML, and development models using ARIMA, SARIMA, VAR, UCM, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.The recipes do a great job comparing different methods and guide you to different evaluation techniques for univariate, multivariate, multiple-seasonality, and other types of time series data.

"This is the bible for anyone doing dyadic research. Within the social sciences, researchers are collectively beginning to realize the importance of acknowledging interdependence in their data to conduct more meaningful statistical analyses, whether it be a simple mixed-measures ANOVA, MLM, of SEM. The authors do a fine job explaining why interdependence is important to account for and what happens if you ignore it. They follow it up with techniques of analyzing dyadic data using various statistical procedures. It helps going into this book if you are comfortable with some statistical nuts and bolts, such as the theory behind hypothesis testing and analyses of variance. Of course, knowledge of more advanced techniques such as MLM and SEM won't hurt either.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dyadic Data Analysis (Methodology in the Social Sciences)

"I first read Tukey's book maybe 30 years ago. It had a profound effect on me. I had always spent time playing with data: this analysis, that analysis, various plots, etc. But I had never thought of it as something that could be approached in a systematic way, and that that there were many ""easy"" back-of the envelope techniques for getting a sense of your data to quickly understand what you had. In a sense Tukey licensed the idea that data was fun to play with and something that you could just fiddle with as much as you wanted.I think of it as in the same class as mental arithmetic: sure, you have a calculator on your phone; but it's way too slow to get out of your pocket and poke at the screen when all you want is 7*9 or even 387/3. Stem-and-leaf plots let you get a quick idea of what's there, without having to write some script. These skills come in handy all the time.Like everyone, I use a computer for non-trivial data analysis. But Tukey is usually in there, somewhere. For example his box-and-whisker diagrams are in many if not all plotting packages. They look nice and you might even have used them. But understanding the original insights lets you use these tools more effectively.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exploratory Data Analysis (Classic Version) (Pearson Modern Classic)
"I was not surprised to see that one of the issues raised by previous reviewers is whether or not this book is still relevant, given the enormous improvements in computing since this book was written. While I recognize that there are a lot of good ideas in this book, I must say that far too much of the text is devoted to techniques that are only relevant if one is doing data analysis on paper. This is certainly not to slander Tukey's own extensive knowledge of computing -- simply an admission of the fact that when EDA was written, few readers would have had access to any computing resources, let alone anything comparable to those that are available today. Today, the books suffers for this. A new version of this book, updated to take advantage of today's computing resources, would be quite valuable.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Exploratory Data Analysis (Classic Version) (Pearson Modern Classic)

"This book provides an excellent step-by-step introduction to statistics and Stata. It covers the basics of the research process, data collection, sampling, questionnaire design, and writing research (with a good overview of how to do research projects). There is a separate chapter on writing research papers, which rare in this kind of book. Notably, it also includes APA guidance.This book could be covered two semester stats course. Ideally, it would be used in an intermediate-advanced undergraduate course or a lower level graduate class. It addresses both methods and stats. It could be also used with a methods class doing a quantitative research project. Scholars might find it helpful for brushing up.The text addresses how different analyses are used in different fields, descriptive stats, hypothesis testing, covers key topics, and expected tables. It was pleasantly surprising to see regression diagnostics, logit/probit,  and regression analysis with categorical dependent variables addressed.The text uses clear straightforward language and includes no heavy math review (which often turns people away). There are news articles pop outs, framed in the current context but also relying on media that students are likely to encounter regularly. Simple definitions are provided for complicated terminology, no sidebar boxes for definitions are necessary. There are many subsections to thoroughly breakdown topics. Commands appear in bold throughout the text and in the index. Each chapter also includes a summary of commands. The book includes a glossary, name index, and subject index. There is also an appendix of stata commands.",5.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis Using Stata: From Research Design to Final Report

It talks about open-and close-ended questions to use in surveys and what kind of surveys you should use at different times. It reminds you about the basic, fundamental data sets like the General Social Survey, talks about distribution and regression.

"The rise of social media we have massive amounts of data at our fingertips.  What we do with all this information is up to us.  Have you ever have logged on to face the only to discover the friend who has a post with one single data point and uses that as the basis of their argument?  It’s perfectly acceptable to take a stance on a hot topic but you’ll come out looking foolish if you don’t understand the statistics and data points behind your argument.  Don’t be that person.In comes Naked StatisticsGrowing up, I was never fond of mathematics.  I struggled in high school with a solid 65 average (that is borderline failing in the United States), and a long believed that now just wasn’t for me.  It was until recently ago that I discovered I really do love numbers and specifically statistics.  It’s around this all the time whether through social media or my favorite thing, gaming.  Looking back, I think educators were not ever explaining to me in a way that grabbed my attention that made me want to further my math education.  The blame can’t lie solely on the educators I grew up with, so I recently took it into my own hands to further my own understanding of math.I stumbled across the audio book Naked Statistics by Charles Wheelan, a professor at Dartmouth college.  I found the narration to the enticing and upon finishing the audio book actually bought the physical copy and marked it up heavily with notes of my own.Throughout the book the author gives great detail about how statistics can truly improve our lives while the same time helping readers understand the power that comes with it and how the power can be used and negative ways as well.Now there are a few key points I want to highlight about the book:Statistics rarely offer a single “right” way of doing anythingStatistics can be powerful for establishing an argumentHoweverStatistics can also be very easy to misuseThe book opens with an explanation of the classic Monty Hall problem, which is a brain teaser in the form of a probability puzzle loosely based on the 1980’s television show “Let’s Make a Deal”.  I’d never quite comprehend it the full detail of this problem until this book.  I encourage you to look into unknown because not only to find to be interesting but also provided a great starting point for understanding for help powerful statistics can truly be.Uses of StatisticsDescription and comparisonInferenceAssessing risk and probabilityIdentifying important relationships (correlation)Descriptive Statistics“Who was the best baseball player of all time?”Descriptive statistics can be technically accurate yet pretty misleading.  The author explains that “The good news is that these descriptive statistics gives us a manageable and meaningful summary of the underlying phenomenon,” and continues with “the bad news is that any simplification invites abuse.”Wheelan highlights the Gini Index, which is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income distribution of the nation’s residents and most commonly used to measure inequality.  The problem however is that this is a mere useless stat.  It simply takes the per capita income of a nation and divides it by the number of people.  But who was actually earning how much of that income?  That is the key missing piece.Precision vs AccuracyThe author goes on to describe the differences between precision and accuracy.Precision: “The exactitude with which we can express something”Accuracy: “Measure of whether a figure is broadly consistent with the truth”Correlation“Measures the degree to which two phenomena are related to one another.Correlation coefficient: Expressed on a scale of -1 -> 11: every change in one variable is associated with an equivalent change in the other variable in the same direction-1: every change in one variable is associated with an equivalent change in the other variable in the opposite directionProbability:“Study of events in outcomes including elements of uncertainty.”There were a few key takeaways from this chapter:Don’t play Lotto (Pg. 80)You should invest in the stock market if you have a long-term investment horizon (because stocks typically have the best long-term returns)Probability is not deterministicThere are several problems with probability, however.  The 2008 Wall Street crash and financial crisis largely had to do with computers misusing probability. The VaR model, or Value at Risk, which was called “potentially catastrophic”.  Value at risk is a measure of risk in investments, and estimates how much a set of investments might lose given normal market conditions and a set time period, such as any day.  This model offered 99% reassurance about 1% is the difference between success and failure.The importance of data (Garbage in and out)When working with numbers you assume that you retrieve and good data, but no amount of fancy analysis can make up for fundamentally flawed data.Selection bias: “How have you chosen the samples you are evaluating?”Self-selection bias: “Will arise whenever individuals volunteer to be any treatment group.”Publication bias: “positive findings are more likely to be published”This distorts the research that we see, or more evidently, do not see.  This pious comes from not directly his studies themselves but from the skewed information that reaches the public.  Typically, medical journals now require that any study be registered at the beginning of the project to help combat this problem of only publishing information that researchers want to see.Inference“The process by which data speaks to us enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions.” The typical tool that researchers will use is a hypothesis, which is a proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.While statistical inference offers many benefits it also comes with some significant pitfalls.  Notably, statistical inference is based on a probability, And not some sort of absolute certainty.PollingThe power polling comes also comes from the central limit theorem, similar to other forms of sampling. Where it differs however, is that we don’t care about the mean, but we actually care about the percentage, or proportion relative to our results. But again, this can be powerful for example the poll of 1000 individuals can offer meaningful insight into the attitudes of an entire nation.Regression Analysis“Allows us to quantify the relationship between a particular variable and how come we care about, while controlling for other factors.” It’s important to note there are many pitfalls of regression analysis, and is the hydrogen bomb of the statistical arsenal! Most of the studies that you read about in the newspaper are based on regression analysis.Bringing it all togetherNow that you’re more informed, consider these aspects of statistics the next time you stumble across an infographic on social media which illustrates only one point, or discover an article which takes a stand on a topic. I never realized how large of a role statistics plays in my life, but the author’s enthusiasm and clear instruction helped me to not only appreciate it, but has also further sparked my interest.If you have other books you’d like to recommend regarding math, business, or computer science, I’d love to hear about them.Key Takeaways:Statistics rarely offer a single “right” way of doing anythingStatistics can be powerful for establishing an argumentHoweverStatistics can also be very easy to misuse",5.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data

"This book serves such an incredibly important purpose in that it really explains the fundamentals of statistics in a way that can be appreciated and understood by the vast majority of reasonably educated laymen.Of course, that in itself begs the question:  so what?  What about statistics is so ""important"" that the average person should take notice?  Well, for a lot of reasons that Mr. Wheelan explains so well its hard to add anything to it, but I'll give one brief attempt for those of you bothering to read the review:  At its core, statistics is about organizing data in a meaningful way such that we can draw accurate conclusions about our environment...in other words, statistics can help us make sense of the world around us in a very meaningful and practical way.  Statistics is really just a mathematically formalized form of what our brains do intuitively, and without that core concept of filtering and making sense of the information we're exposed to we would all be paralyzed - unable to make associations, draw conclusions, or derive any meaning from our environment.  Learning would be impossible, life would be meaningless, and existence and survival itself would be impossible.  Statistics takes that core function and focuses it in very particular ways, which if done correctly, can yield amazing results that add worthwhile knowledge and positivity to life.  To quote the book, ""Statistics is the most powerful tool we have for using information to some meaningful end.""Further, if that description doesn't at least somewhat tempt you how about this:  Even if you don't care about statistics, those that have enormous influence on your life and happiness  (e.g. businesses, politicians, government organizations, media, and everybody else that has a vested interested in influencing your mindset, perspectives, and behaviors) very much care about statistics and use them, for both good and ill, to ""help"" you see and do things a certain way.  Knowledge of statistics can help transform you from ""propagandized"" to ""informed"".  This is one of my favorite aspects of the book, that is, the author acknowledges and recognizes the danger of inappropriately used statistics; he even conceived the book as an homage to 
How to Lie with Statistics: 1st (First) Edition
, and as he very correctly points out right in the introduction of the book, ""Statistics is like a high-caliber weapon:  helpful when used correctly and potentially disastrous in the wrong hands.""Amazingly, this book is a fun and enjoyable read.  No seriously.  Mr. Wheelan exposes himself as a fantastic teacher, bringing an enthusiasm and energy to the subject coupled with a gift of explaining ideas and concepts in a way that most (not just ""stat people"") can understand and appreciate.Although this isn't a ""textbook"" per se, I think it remains relevant for the whole spectrum of people from total ""newbies"" all the way to hard-core statistics researchers.  Why?  Fundamentals.  The author explains the fundamentals in a clear concise way using practical, relevant, and familiar examples from our everyday lives.  For those new to the subject you'll get an ""intro to statistics"" class from a very gifted Ivy-league professor that will give you a solid well-rooted realistic foundation that you can both apply to your everyday life as well as prepare you for higher level statistics courses if you so choose.  For those already well-versed in statistics or professionals, it will reacquaint you with why what you do matters as well as provide you a wonderful way to explain to others why what you do matters.  Personally, I'm somewhere in the middle in that I've had a reasonably high level statistics background (relative to the average college graduate, anyway) and as I read the book I kept thinking to myself, ""Man, if only I had had this before taking my first stats course!""Outstanding book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"How many times have you wondered how two different people looking at the same report managed to draw totally opposite conclusions? How many times have you looked at a set of data yourself and decided that the data must be wrong because it doesn't show what you ""know"" to be true? Well, I suspect that you aren't alone. I suspect that you also have an aversion to ""doing the math"" necessary to convince yourself that the data is actually correct.Wheelan claims that ""Statistics is like a high-caliber weapon: helpful when used correctly and potentially disastrous in the wrong hands."" This is an incredibly important topic as we move forward into our increasingly connected world where we are creating data at an accelerating rate. The data is only raw knowledge, how we analyze that data is what allows us to derive useful information to create actionable knowledge. The tools we use to analyze the data is, like it or not, statistics. Wheelan gives us an easy to follow and understand overview of statistics. Even if you didn't like math in school, you will find this book useful as well as insightful.Here's the rub. No matter how hard we try, when using descriptive statistics, we lose the detail in the data. We've ""summarized"" it and just like the summary of a good book, we will miss a lot of the nuance in the story. Neither this review nor the summary of data known as descriptive statistics is an exception to that rule. And because of that loss of fidelity, we will find as Wheelan puts its, ""Smart and honest people will often disagree about what the data are trying to tell us.""Wheelan includes many examples of how statistics is enlightening and infuriating. The examples are from everyday life and you are likely to recognize them; things like ""Money Ball"" and the ""Wall Street failure."" You will learn about correlation, basic probability, the Central Limit Theorem, Inferences, Polling, Regression Analysis and more. All without tears!So why should you be interested? Because the big questions will be answered by statistical analysis and you will want to know at least enough to not be ""taken in"" by those who would purposely try and confuse you or convert you to their views using statistics and data. Wheelan believes that there are five ""large"" questions that statistics will help us answer in the future.1. What is the future of football? Will it die of concussions?2. What (if anything) is causing the dramatic rise in the incidence of autism?3. How can we identify and reward good teachers and schools?4. What are the best tools for fighting global poverty?5. Who gets to know what about you?Wheelan doesn't answer these questions. The data is still being collected and analyzed. What he has done, however, is set the reader on the right path to understanding the complexity of those questions and why there aren't any easy answers. He has given the reader at least a working knowledge of statistics so that we can decide for ourselves who is doing the best job of presenting the information and knowledge buried in ever expanding universe of dots for us to connect. The sub title of this excellent book is ""Stripping the dread from the data."" What I found is that now I know how to make sure that I strip the dread from the statistics which applies to the data. The dread is when the proper use of statistics on that data shows my cherished beliefs to be ill conceived!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"For lay people interested in better understand the world of data and statistics, this book and Tim Harford's ""The Data Dectective"" are the two books I most highly recommend.I first read this while in undergrad. Now with a few years of professional work, and a nearly completed grad program, I decided to re-read Naked Statistics. This book was one of the things that sparked my interest in statistics and data in undergrad. Now with more experience and expertise, I realize just how thorough yet succinct the text is. Wheelan writes in a very informal way that I think is approachable for a wide audience. It's certainly not a dry read like all my beloved textbooks. I particularly love how he focuses on intuition and non-technical explanations first then dives into more nitty-gritty details after he's shown how non-intimidating and intuitive the statistical idea really is. I think this approach will prevent readers from getting turned off when the mathematical details are explained (though those are also simplified significantly for lay readers).I plan on teaching data and statistics soon at my local technical college, and will use this book as my outline for an intro to stats class and make it required reading. The combination of detail and approachable content is perfect to educate without turning students off the subject. Of course more advanced texts are needed to learn how to practice statistics in the real world, but this is a good addition to those more rigorous texts.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"This book is excellent. It offers an easy-to-read discussion of probability and statistics.It might not be ""mathy"" enough for some folks, but for the many people who will rely on their computer to do the math, lacking equations is probably good.However, in my edition of the book, there is a printing glitch that turns the square root sign into a series of dots that cover other parts of the formula (see photos). This means the formulas are pretty much worthless:Does ....(.53)(1-.53) / 500 mean to take the square root of the first term (.53), the square root of the numerator (.53)(1-0.53) or the square root of the whole formula? There is no way to tell, unless you try the different options on your calculator and see which one is correct.This glitch seems to run throughout the book -- I don't think there are any square root signs that are properly type set.I'd happily give this book a five-star rating, but in its present form -- an entirely fixable problem if the printer / typesetter / proofreader did their job -- a couple of stars need to be subtracted.Given how many books I read and how infrequently I see this sort of glitch, I'd say this is a low probability event.The printer should recall all these defective books, shred them, and reprint them with the correct formulas. I'm not sure what the probability of W.W. Norton doing this might be.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"I just finished reading Naked Statistics by Charles Wheelan.  This book met all my expectations.  It provides an excellent description of the field of statistics.  Although statistics is just a little over 100 years old, it has obviously become the way that we describe the world and at least an intuitive understanding of these concepts is important.  I would strongly recommend this group for two groups of people.  The first group would be people like myself who are interested in the general understanding of statistics and have no desire whatsoever to do any of the manipulations that are necessary if you want to be a real statistician.Mr. Wheelan did an excellent job in describing a number of things that are of great interest to me as a physician.  Those include his excellent discussion of type 1 and type 2 errors, the miracle of regression analysis and how powerful this can be, particularly in medical studies.  Another area is that he described the counter intuitive situation with Monty Hall on Let's Make a Deal about as well as anyone has.  So many times when I read about this, I understand it for an hour or so, but then my old way of thinking seems to slip back in.  When that happens, I am going to go back and review his chapter.The second group of people that I would recommend this for are young people that are starting out in a career in medicine or any other area and especially those that are taking their first statistics class. I think a great problem with education, especially in medical school and postgraduate medical school training, is that the students jump into the middle of statistics without understanding their purpose or their basic concepts and rarely come away with anything more than a mechanical understanding of the subject.I can highly recommend this book for any of the two groups that I have just mentioned.  I would give it a 5-star rating.  Because of this experience, I have just started to read Professor Wheelan's previous book, Naked Economics.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"Yes, there are lots of ""dear reader"" type comments throughout the book. Yes, the examples and references are drawn from up-to-the-minute pop culture. And, yes, if you don't know very much about statistics and probability you can learn fairly ""painlessly"" in this book.One drawback: you really, really need to read the entire book from start to finish to really understand all of the concepts. This is not a reference book in which you can ""jump around"" or just go to the parts you have questions about.It's like being given a prescription for antibiotics; you really need to read every chapter in the book, to ""take it all."" Concepts build on previous chapters, up to the final chapter. Don't stop or you will miss out!On the other hand, this is not a book for someone who wants to quickly, at-a-glance understand probability or who wants to get a solid definition of any statistical concept, such as confidence level or regression analysis. It is not specifically a reference book.I confess, my prejudice is for more concise information without all the ""fluff."" On the other hand, I work with opinion survey statistics almost every day of my worklife, so I don't need to be lured in with tales of baseball (in which I have no interest) or discussions of what's behind the doors in Let's Make a Deal. (In fact, I have never, ever seen that show.)However, if you are in business or education or health care and don't have a complete grasp of statistics, I recommend you read this book. If you want to better understand whether you should buy a lottery ticket or buy insurance and you don't understand probability theory, I recommend this book to you. If you read media and want to have a better understanding of polls, scientific experiments, clinical trials and don't understand statistics, then I recommend this book to you.If this book piques your interest in the topics, I suggest you next obtain a couple of the more traditional, ""duller"" stat books that you can use as handy references for specific concepts. Of course, if you already have that much interest in stats, you probably already have those books. Or you know where to go online to find reference materials.There are a few tiny, tiny little things that could have been better. I think he could have included the ""name"" for symbols, such as sigma when he first introduced them. Also, I don't like the way he would ""jump"" back and forth on examples.Overall, I recommend this book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"This book accomplishes what the author set out to do: to inform you of the rationale and logic behind statistical reasoning, which is very a very useful top-down method of understanding your data before you even set out to model. I enjoyed reading about the various practical examples, except for the annoying sports references that keep popping up. If you're not a sports fan and don't much care for anything having to do with sports like I am, you'll get bored of these pretty quickly - I found myself just glossing over or omitting an entire section while reading if it's about why some dude had some record. I DON'T CARE!Also, I find the author's tone to be extremely condescending at times when he's trying to explain technicals to his ""lay"" audience. Phrases like, ""here's how you can wrap your mind around this"" threw me off completely. I understand that your targeted audience is non-experts in statistics but that doesn't mean that we're complete idiots. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy learning a difficult mathematical or technical concept when someone is using the explain-it-to-me-like-I'm-five method because it  is simple enough that a child can understand it. But you don't talk down to children when you're trying to teach them something. Maybe it's just me and I'm overly sensitive to that kind of things but it just did not feel right when I was reading. Also, I found it hard to relate to his personal anecdotes. I got the sense that he came from a privileged background and his listing of the fun and wonderful things he's doing with his life currently just made me cringe. Yeah, that's nice that you get to publish books and go to the Taj Mahal or whatever exotic corners of the world. Thanks for sharing but not interested. Please just stick to what you do best: explain statistics! Also, his trolling of his high school teacher just tells me that he was an annoying and pompous brat.So, anyway, if you can ignore the stupid sports references and the annoying bragging, this book is plentiful in good tips for someone who is interested in being eased slowly into the higher concepts of statistical analysis, not so much the math but just the ideas behind how things are analyzed. Very big-picture and very little formulas, which I think is extremely helpful especially if you're taking a graduate data science class and you're overwhelmed with all the sigma, omega, and pi formulas. The author's very good at explaining basic stats such as mean, mode, probability, etc. and illustrating his points with examples, which is not something textbooks are keen to do. I think the author does a great job explaining, also, the rationale and logic behind statistical reports and problems as well as exposing the reader to the intuitive thinking and judgment when dealing with statisticsl. It's a fun and informative read, overall.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"I have been a CTO for ten years for companies big and small and have had to face the “legacy architect refactoring” challenge outlined in this book multiple times. This book would have saved us a lot of pain.  While the tech and tooling for distributed architectures has gotten better and better the process for getting there hasn’t.  The playbook outlined here is a must have for anyone facing the architecture modernization challenge.A few things that would make this book even better- Integrating DDD concepts especially around aggregates- Adding additional and/or more detailed decision dimensions for the people aspect (skills, org size and ability to grow, org design, etc), operations architecture, and development architecture.  When making decisions these things have to be accounted for and these aspects seemed underplayed a bit.Overall though this is one of the most pragmatic books on tech I have read in a long time.

"This is a great book. I enjoyed it far more than the fundamentals book.  If you can master Kleppmann for the infrastructure grounding and this for real life use cases you'll be well on your way.  I really appreciated the fact that they point out tradeoffs *everywhere*.  That's part of the job and it can be hard to see them when we gravitate toward one option because it feels right or because of groupthink.Some minor criticisms:* the Data Mesh chapter felt tacked on, underdeveloped and in some places was incorrect or at least confusing (e.g. it says data warehouses cause loss of domain partitioning which is not true)* The book talked about tradeoffs so much it wasn't always clear why they thought taking a certain path would hurt a certain quality attribute.  ""Because there is more coupling scalability will suffer"", etc.  Perhaps. But explaining how would be great.  The book hints at some relationships between quality attributes. If that were more well-developed that could be a way to better understand these statements too.* While I'm sure it wasn't meant for effect, there is only one woman in the story portions, she is somewhat naive, a bossy PITA and has to be dragged along most of the time.

"First, the book smells bad. Literally.But w.r.t. the content - typical Java-Enterprise-camp OOP/DDD stuff: too high level to be applicable or useful in real life.

And if you do have some clue and experience, you'll easily see that there's nothing really insightful in it.These books are mostly written to get reputation as a subject expert, which helps score well paid enterprise consulting contracts, not to make you learn anything  practically useful.

I thought that this book was the sequel. It’s not. Similar topics are followed. The authors did deep into the weeds. I think that some material could have been reduced and presented more tightly. There were a few times when I thought: just get to the point. The real benefit of this book is that the authors try to provide thought leadership to architects who have to make decisions found in this book. I really like that the authors intentionally state that architecture is a lot more than a design pattern and the choices architects face are not  boilerplate in terms of picking one pattern instead of another.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Software Architecture: The Hard Parts: Modern Trade-Off Analyses for Distributed Architectures

"Alrighty, here comes a dose of truth and reality for this author.It appears to me this is an author who does know SQL, but perhaps has lost sight that he has completely left newbies to SQL behind and has absolutely no clue what to do when self-publishing a book.I have to agree with some of the lower ratings here, this book has several errors with incorrect syntax which will only frustrate a newcomer to SQL...and has forgotten too to provide illustrations or examples from where queries are pulling, this is only going to confuse a beginner.Where are the explanations about why you are doing what you are doing? This is something a newbie needs, or the difference between the different types of coding for lets say SQL or SQLite? This is bound trip newbies up too, one cannot use the exact same thing for either. This was something I really struggled with when being introduced to SQL.Yes, there are good things to be had in this book which is the only reason I did not give merely 1 star, but there are just too many errors for me to recommend to to someone wanting to learn.Also, HUGE marks off for COMPLETELY leaving the book title and author name off the the spine of the printed book as well as having absolutely NOTHING on the back to say what this book is about...REALLY???? Who does this?? Does this author have ANY idea what a bad impression this makes? Wow, I have reviewed hundreds of books a year over the last decade and have NEVER seen this before. This screams ""I don't know what I'm doing!""Why would I listen to this author about anything if he makes this big of a mistake when it comes to something just about everyone knows when it comes to books....has he ever picked a book in print up?  Perhaps he shouldn't have self-published, or maybe he just doesn't want anyone to actually find his book on a book shelf.If he doesn't take his own book seriously enough to find out what he should have done when publishing it, I can't take his advice seriously either.UPDATE: I've tried using this book for a few months now.

"I really enjoyed this book. This book is great for python programmers who want to learn/implement something cool with data using Pandas (of-course). With some programming background in python/R/C, this book is perfect for the data scientist wannabe. Every chapter has a very interesting exercise set. Easy to follow. I am glad that the author has provided the github repo for this too, way better than reading code from the book alone! The book starts from easy steps e.g., import data, transform, basic computations, more fancy topics like plotting, to more advanced and application-specific like finance, machine learning (yes the book also talked about this in practical aspect!, using sklearn), security analytics!I can't say enough good things about this book and about how effective it is. I started 10 days ago with a skill of python but no data science background. Now, nearly two weeks later, I'm making my scripts do all kinds of things that are complicated if you don't know Pandas e.g., aggregate statistics based on duration (day, week, ..). I genuinely found this book and the exercises a truly beneficial experience/resource. Honestly I usually don't trust this publisher. Most Packt books I own I think weren't worth their price. This book is surprisingly good quality.

"Chapters 1-6 were some of the best written I have ever written.  But who the heck thought that the best way to bring all that knowledge together in chapter 7 was to condense it all in a single chapter along with very advanced object oriented programming (not mentioned yet in the book before Ch 7), decorators and financial market concepts??? Why would you do that?  You don't jump from basic knife usage to advanced neurosurgery in a single chapter.  Sure there is a ""Further Reading"" section where one might be able to eventually puzzle out the meaning of the concepts that the author machine guns at you.  But if I was going to do that anyway, why do I need this book?  Very frustrating!I guess the chapter is good to show an end point of ""You will know you are an advanced python user when you can understand this chapter"", but that is a goal and not a plan.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands-On Data Analysis with Pandas: Efficiently perform data collection, wrangling, analysis, and visualization using Python"

"The book includes concepts that are tremendously valuable, but the author is unable to explain these concepts in a lucid manner. Approximately 40% of the book is written in mathematical notation and the author rarely takes the time to define the notation that he uses. At times, it seems like the author purposefully obfuscates the material because his explanations on simple financial concepts are laboriously dense. The author cannot describe simple concepts such as the natural log, or normal distributions in a lucid manner. In regard to more difficult concepts, the reader will be spending ample time at Khan Academy and on the web attempting to deduce the notation and concepts.

"I have spent a number of years working through the 1st Edition. Not only has the book served as a foundation for my understanding in this area, it continues to serve as a ready reference for actual projects I've endeavored. I do not consider myself a mathematical savant so working through the theory is not always easy but it is definitely doable (and, I might add, necessary to have an understanding of what you're actually doing). I would consider Ruppert's approach a nice balance between mathematical rigor and the pressing need for actual application. A reasonable understanding of matrix operations, basic mathematical stats is definitely helpful before coming to the book but not a deal killer. I have not mastered this material and some areas yet remain out of my grasp (copulas, MCMC). Still, I feel like a beggar who has been allowed into the banquet hall to enjoy most of the choice foods yet hasn't yet feasted on the mutton...I am in much better condition than when I entered!!In my mind this book gave me exactly what I was looking for: a launching pad for a better working knowledge of this field. The R code, introduction to some key packages, and custom functions created by the author are all well placed and easy to incorporate. I am getting ready to purchase the 2d edition as I understand that it has more R code & examples, reference to MGARCH, among other things.If you are looking to copy and paste stuff, go to StackOverflow. However, if you are looking for understanding of the material and you're willing to put in a little work and not get too wound up when your understanding doesn't quite keep up with your desires, give the book a try.

"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is an easy-to-read and quick-to-apply Python book with many practical program examples. Thanks, Al!I didn't do any programming other than simple automation shell scripts after graduation. This summer, I wanted to help my interns build a new MVP (minimum viable product). I was keen to develop some automation tools to help my customers control their cameras. I am glad that  I took action to learn and code in Python!I was lucky to find ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python""! The book cover is eye-catching. The preface is clear about what readers can achieve from the book. The code examples and quizzes are very useful and practical, such as how to find information using Regular Expressions, send text messages with Twilio, and draw text on images.

"I have six books from this company now, three on Linux and three on Python. All are excellent additions to any library. The material they present continues to be easy to understand with every new book I buy from them. Coding is NOT easy, there's a lot of stuff to learn and tons that you've got to commit to memory. These books make the process enjoyable, and they use practical examples that make it a lot easier to understand things like the flow of logic within statements.Allow me to give a little context: I started with computers in the 80's when I was a kid. BASIC was all I had access to, fun, but not a great start. My first PC came along and I learned DOS, despite the mostly crappy documentation. Linux came along at the end of the 90's and, while it was a great OS back then, documentation held it back on the desktop. Best I could do was get it to boot, so Windows was the only choice for a couple decades.Flash forward to the present, and I've ditched Windows completely, picked up a couple books (I don't yet own a book on Linux NOT published by No Starch) and I do better now with Linux than I ever did with Windows. Linux documentation quality is also light-years beyond what it was in the 90's, too. I spent a month on Mint and went straight to Arch. Things have changed THAT much.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, 2nd Edition: Practical Programming for Total Beginners"
"This book is intended for beginners, and really breaks down python in a very approachable manner. Despite that being said, I wouldn't recommend this book to a beginner. In the preface, the author mentions that this book uses many bad habits (or at the very least frowned upon habits), which is true. Many of coding examples are inefficient (which, to the author's credit, he acknowledges), and while the code might run, it's not going to be pretty. The projects look worthwhile, and those alone would be what I'd argue makes the book worth it. Many novice developers (as well as intermediate & advanced) can shrug off the idiosyncrasies that are presented in this book, but a person brand new to coding would likely misunderstand the material, ultimately leading to bad habits that'll be harder to unlearn.For a true beginner, I'd recommend the Python Crash Course book by the same publisher (No Starch Press). The fundamentals are clearly presented, and easy to understand. The foundation developed will be stronger, and you'll be less likely to develop bad habits, since most of the material is presented in a manner consistent with the python community (PEP).For example, the way variables and input functions are utilized between the two books are drastically different. In this book, user input and assignment is handled as follows:print('What's your name?')name = input()This is inefficient, and somewhat confusing, given that the alternative (as presented in Python Crash Course) is easier. In Python Crash Course, the same outcome is presented as follows:name = input(""What is your name? "")The print statement asking for the user's name is excessive.

The projects are very simple to follow, the author even provides the source code for you if you don’t want to hand code it out (even though I definitely recommend coding along yourself to learn). I have purchased so many books and tools along my learning journey but this one is by far my absolute favorite and the cover is worn with proof of use and love.

"I'm currently a college student not studying CS at the moment but needing to know a lot of the core key concepts with languages such as Python for data science and software engineering projects. I had a lot of experiences with online courses such as those on Udemy, Coursera, and Codecademy, but I felt like all of these were very lacking when it came to the support and resources behind these courses. As a college student trying to teach myself while observing my CS friends, I realized that the most important difference between taking college classes and self-studying is the community and on-demand support that books lack. Fortunately, a book like this has a whole community behind it and the support I have gotten is amazing! On top of not having to worry about grades for my classes, I can actually focus on learning Python without having to think about what assignments I need to allocate my efforts to.

"I am working through this book and haven't finished it yet.  I am a long term programmer having programmed for pay in Fortran for multiple jobs.  I have been programming for over 30 years and learning an object oriented language requires a shift in perspective.  So, I need little in algorithm development but details on the language features is important and capabilities to do the things that were simple in other languages is important to know how to do it in Python.  This book is very complementary to the book Think Python, IMHO.I am working in Data Science and Machine Learning in particular and found that my ability to program in Python was lacking.  So far this book has done a very good job familiarizing me with how to do certain critical things in Python.  For Data Science having a section on web site data scraping is very important.  I could just look how to do this.  Also the data structures are much richer and varied. In Fortran you created any complexity in data structure yourself.

The author includes lots of java code where you can implement it on your own and just look it up if you actually do have any trouble. The exercises are good practice, but many of them were much more difficult to do than you would expect after reading a chapter. so the content for the book was very good for me as a student, i always reference back to it to check how some algorithms go and whatnot.

"Look, I'll be honest. I'm one of the few students that actually uses and appreciates textbooks. I don't like doing my reading online either because I like having a physical copy to mark, make notes in, and pass through. And I don't often groan about textbooks either. Sure, they're overwhelmingly boring. But for the most part, I find them useful (some more than others) and read them cover to cover. So to get me cranky about a textbook you have to do your fair share.And oh does Mark Allen Weiss deliver. The book is a complete nightmare. A great textbook is able to walk the reader through each part of the field he's learning, teaching it to him one piece at a time. I've always said if a textbook is great, you should be able to learn the subject from it without the aid of a teacher. Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java isn't even adequate or below par -- it's straight garbage. It's the sort of book that makes one thankful for the premise of Farenheit 451.The author frequently likes to explain things while missing out important steps in the logic -- steps which may be obvious to experts in the field, people who have been studying computer science and mathematics for a long time, or exceptionally keen students, but which will utterly befuddle the rest of us. His English is clunky. He has a very unique talent for phrasing things in the most non-intuitive way possible. Relatively simple topics become a nightmare.I've spent the semester spending hours on Khan Academy, Google, or in my instructor's office seeking clarification of topics because trying to learn from this book is utterly hopeless. I'm learning Data Structures just fine, but this book has only been an obstacle to that process, not a help.Do not waste your money on this garbage. You won't use it.

I bought this textbook as an additional resource to used, and even though I've only read a couple of pages, I felt strongly compelled to write a review.  So far, my only complaint is that the reading seems ineffectively heavy such as when explaining what vertices and edges are in Graph Theory; vertices are nodes, or points in a graph, and edges connect vertices together, but the author in this textbook uses wordy paragraphs to explain vertices and edges; while some complex concepts do require detail descriptions, you shouldn't have to put any effort in comprehending basic concepts.

"Bottom line: if your priority is to learn or review concepts, this book will serve you well. If you're looking more for quizzes and practice tests, I would recommend against this. I found the question bank to be actively detrimental to my understanding and full of errors.The book itself is very good. It clearly explains the concepts for the exam and strikes a good balance between detail and not overwhelming the student.The problem is that the quizzes and practice exams included are not even close to the same quality. Between the questions where the ""correct"" answer directly contradicts the text, to those where an entirely made-up throwaway choice is somehow the right answer, to those where the explanation refers to a different question than what was asked, there's a massive dropoff in quality from the text itself.The Wiley website where the quizzes and tests are hosted (mandatory signup to access the two full practice tests and flashcards, optional for the chapter quizzes) is ok, although the registration process seems purpose-built to be annoying.Since Data+ is still a new exam as I'm writing this, there aren't a lot of study resources available. Unfortunately, it seems like this study guide was rushed out to try and take advantage of that fairly empty market.

We are 1/3 of the way through the book.  I correct my child's work and rarely consult the answer key, whenever I do I find errors.  (In other words, sometimes I look because the problem is poorly worded, see the answer and understand or see it is flat out wrong).  Today, I found 3 errors, which does not include the poorly worded problem issue.  Are there only errors on the pages I look at?  Who knows.  Another minor issue, telling the child to use a tree diagram when a chart makes more sense or vice versa.In sum, I do like the math concepts covered here.

"After another, full read, I continue to maintain that the ambitious premise that human judgment in decision-making can be codified, taught, and honed is proven in Decisions Over Decimals. The authors articulate a process that right-sizes the Goldilocks compromise between data paralysis and gut feel – and do this credibly through their collective experience from companies ranging from startups to the most data-rich organizations.  As someone who has influenced many decisions for my company's clients over the course of my career, this quote really sticks out: ""we must be aware of thepresence of bias and the impact it’s having on us in order to check it, control it and minimizeit wherever possible.""  Bias can be pervasive in the way we all (formally or informally) collect and process data and from that glean insights.  Decisions Over Decimals provides a clear path for decision makers to balance rigor versus ""gut feel"" in a systemic, situation-appropriate way.  Bravo!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Decisions Over Decimals: Striking the Balance between Intuition and Information
"Last July, I had the honor to participate in a super insightful block week course at Columbia Business School about developing quantitative intuition taught by Oded Netzer, Christopher Frank, and Paul Magnone, the top experts in their fields. It was one of the highlights of my MBA studies, and out of the things that I mostly liked in this course was that it was very practical. I could implement the insights from the study almost instantly in the way I think about data-driven decisions (IWIKs, Guestimating, Synthesizing, etc.)Recently they published their last book, “Decisions Over Decimals: Striking the Balance between Intuition and Information,” about one of the crucial abilities for the decision makers today.“Successful decision-makers are fierce interrogators. They square critical thinking with open-mindedness by blending information, intuition, and experience. Balancing these elements is at the heart of Decisions Over Decimals.”(c)Highly recommended if you want to improve the way you think about data driven decisions.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Decisions Over Decimals: Striking the Balance between Intuition and Information

So, any help I can get is welcome.

Between illustrative anecdotes, stories from direct experience, and the incorporation of research and academic results, the authors have really boiled down some insights you can use.I found the book entirely approachable, no need for a Ph.D in data science to gain value here; I expect business folks in my situation will find this useful and pertinent, while casual and entertaining enough to keep you along for the ride.Enjoy!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Decisions Over Decimals: Striking the Balance between Intuition and Information

"This book was pubished at the perfect moment for me while establishing a new TI function in my organisation. It is THE seminal book on the topic, and makes important distinctions between TI and people analytics and how TI complements both workforce/people analytics and recruitment analytics/KPIs. It is an important read for any organisation that has recognized that TI is critical in the early phases of location, organizational structuring, and workforce planning at a time when there is shortage of talent in almost every industry and type of role, from blue collar service technicians and factory and construction workers to software developers to executives in any field. The book provides a clear definition of this emerging field and insight on the trade-offs involved for organisations of any size when deciding what the TI function should do, where it should be located within an organisation, the types of data, tools, and skills necessary to leverage external market data not only to plan tactical talent sourcing and recruitment strategy, but also site location, M&A, go-to-market strategy, talent attraction, diversity planning, competitor organisational analysis, and more. It makes a strong case for partnership between TI and other types of market and financial intelligence as well as how the TA function can be a more strategic partner to the business by leveraging open source market data, proprietary databases, and the as-yet-untapped vast broad market insight recruitment teams gain not only about compensation and benefits and talent but also products, technology, and workplace trends in the market.An extensive chapter summarizing use cases from many different companies and industries is extremely helpful in making the business case for TI and planning TI projects. The book provides information estimating how much time and person-hours might be required for certain kinds of analyses and what both stakeholders and analysts can expect from a new TI function given the organisation's resource constraints.Since TI is a new field, the book acknowledges where the field is going and potential directions in which TI can develop. The author is transparent about sources, definitions, areas of ambiguity.The book is a ""living document"", complemented by the Talent Intelligence Collective Podcast and social media communities, where the definitions and topics in the book are discussed and often refined.Anyone involved in founding a new company, CEOs, and Talent Acquisition leaders making decisions about where to locate, what kinds of people they should hire first, what kinds of benefits and messaging will attract those people, and which organisations they are working for now should start with this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Talent Intelligence: Use Business and People Data to Drive Organizational Performance

"I regard Scott E. Page's The Model Thinker to be the singular 'must read' reference work and learning aid for anyone looking to master conceptual models of the world we live in. For the most part, these are dynamic models, most frequently mathematically described, which are essential to thinking about data; interactions, including conflict, strategies for resolving conflicts between individuals and their respective social groups, institutions, and generally speaking, civilized society itself. A single work of this type cannot include every single permutation of conceptual model; but Professor Page accomplishes a great deal in the 420-odd pages comprising this masterful work.As Professor Page observes, early on, ""we live in a time awash in information and data"". At the same time, our innate abilities to comprehend and deal with the mental load that those data represent, and how to respond appropriately, requires us to acquire new cognitive skills in order to make any headway in dealing with the implications that those data represent.Professor Page identifies seven uses of models: (1) to reason, meaning to identify conditions and deduce logical implications; (2) to explain, meaning to provide testable explanations for empirical phenomena; (3) to design, meaning to choose features of institution, policies, and rules of behavior that will allow particular models to behave as intended; (4) to communicate, meaning to relate knowledge and understandings about the natural world, and human-developed institutions, as they interact with one another; (5) to act, we need to guide policy choices and strategic actions to achieve predictable results; (6) to predict, meaning to make numerical and categorical statements about future and unknown phenomena, based upon historical data or extrapolating from current data, where the trend lines are predicting where we will end up at some point in the future; and finally, (7) to explore, in which we may need to investigate possibilities, hypotheticals, including counterfactuals. The models that Professor Page presents are not reality, but the functions that they explore are found in reality if we look closely enough to find them and are capable of understanding what they are telling us and where we are heading. They are simple, and yet sophisticated. They employ depictions of both physics, and psychology, and a great deal more.In 29 chapters, Professor Page limns the universe of conceptual models and their mathematical and-graphical representations, how they work, and the logical inferences that can be drawn from each of them in terms of the types of outcomes that can be expected when those models are employed to explain numerical, financial, organizational and sociological phenomena. The mathematics described an input-process-output scenario where they simulate natural processes that behave stochastically as if they were governed by predictable mathematical rules.Professor Page repeatedly emphasizes that understanding phenomena, and the data that describes them, requires a knowledge of many models, each one pointing out a specific facet of the whole, and none of them completely describing what the whole actually looks like. TIn many respects, these models are counterintuitive, meaning that left to our own devices we might come to different decisions based upon criteria that fall well short of rational calculation.Nowadays, the science of behavioral economics has, through extensive research, established that in fact, decision-makers are subject to cognitive biases that distort our perception of reality, importance, and value. We perceive and think in much the same way that our ancient forebears did, before formal learning took hold. We as a species are risk aversive by a factor of two over what we might gain from a prospective course of action. We act on the basis of unfounded assumptions and cognitive biases. And this is why dynamic modeling become so important in order to strip away the cognitive tricks that our minds play on us when we encounter new and unfamiliar situations. Using these models, we apply rule-based behaviors that have been time-tested to optimize our chances of succeeding in whatever endeavor we are then engaged.Using dynamic modeling techniques, we also learn to adapt our behavior, based upon the behaviors of others, by applying principles of probability that allow us to calculate the likelihood that certain events will occur, or will not. We learn to adjust our behaviors based upon what happened in the past, but understanding that our revised calculations are still educated guesswork.We also come to understand, as Professor Page teaches us, that different models lead to different outcomes: equilibrium; cycles; randomness or complexity. If a rule-based model generates a random outcome, the rule itself serves only to alert the user that the outcome of the action taken is limited in its predictability; nevertheless, randomness itself can be studied, and the lessons applied, to rule out situations where precise calculations would be necessary to achieve the model user's objectives. Moreover, as Professor Page instructs us, some models generating what at first glance may appear to be randomness may actually be recurring patterns that derive from an extended number of cycles. Now that we can use computers to simulate actions taken over time, the regularity of those secular outcomes can readily be seen. If a model produces an equilibrium, we know that certain actions will ultimately succeed, and others will fail. Other models produce complexity, both internally, and through their interaction with other actors above and below the level at which the model operates. We learned that those complex interactions generate what is referred to as 'emergent behaviors', sometimes higher levels of sophistication, but also phenomena that could not have been anticipated at the operational level at which those models work. This is how models, and those who use them, adapt to changing circumstances.We can also see where particular models favor selfish outcomes at the expense of the community at large, and where the community response to its disadvantage in the economic sphere by changing the rules of engagement through public policy changes that are intended to restrict or deter overreaching by those considered to be bad actors. More on that later.At the core of all models are the notions of statistical distributions, and the way in which probabilities are to be calculated. They are part of the core knowledge base for any modeler, because they determine the ways in which data are perceived and handled. A working knowledge of distributions is necessary to measure inequalities in power, income and wealth, and to perform statistical tests.Professor Page addresses the matter of distributions over two chapters, the first dealing with normal (Gaussian) distributions, often referred to as the Bell Curve. The next chapter deals with power law distributions, i.e., long-tailed events. Distributions mathematically capture variations in diversity within certain types, representing them as probabilities as defined over numerical values or categories, with the bulk of them ordinarily clustered around the statistical mean or average value, with parameters of difference represented as deviations from the mean in a standardized format. Power distributions differ from normal distributions, whereby positive feedback loops augment and reinforce the action or trend that the distribution explains or describes. Two models frequently appear where power laws occur; the first is described as preferential attachment that captures trending preferences about where people choose to live (i.e., cities); which things to buy (i.e., books that become wildly popular simply as a function of either their subject matter or word-of-mouth advertising); certain places on the Internet (i.e. websites such as Facebook), and so on. The second model may consist of self-organized criticality in the form of default choices that lead to predictable consequences, and where under conditions of entropy, where a power law distribution maximizes uncertainty hovering around a fixed mean, but with a proximity to large events that, although they occur infrequently, can have devastating consequences.Along these timelines, normality is correlated in the minds of many observers with frequency of occurrence, a conclusion justified by the number of smaller events clustered around the historical averages during the relevant time periods in the run-up to the present day. It would be as if we are traveling on a highway accelerating as we go, and viewing the highway through the rearview mirror. It is but a small leap of faith to jump to the conclusion that the future will not be markedly different from the past; and the historical record often validates that assumption. Using the normal bell curve to justify that conclusion is really asking the wrong question, because it inherently incorporates the so-called 'survivors bias', those who have averted or avoided catastrophe and lived to tell the tale. At best, it is a psychological pick-me-up that reassures us that whatever happens in the future is survivable, because we have done it before.Well, not entirely, because by focusing on survivable events (because we, or most of us did survive), instead of looking at the risks we are incurring now, with fewer resources and less resilience to withstand future shocks. We have come to realize that statistical probabilities of those large, infrequently experienced events, as represented within a nominal ‘normal distribution’ tend to understate the likelihood that those events will ever occur. In recent decades, for example, turmoil within the financial markets was regarded by many as ‘unforeseeable’; well, those events had been foreseen, and warned against. The argument against foreseeability was simply that it was impolitic, unfashionable, and unprofitable for many to acknowledge the obvious risk that major financial services institutions were running at the time. Accounting for that potentially large downside risk simply did not fit their model, based upon what had gone before.From the standpoint of statistical analysis, there are many who view normal distributions of data from of hindsight from a frequentist perspective, comparing the most recent data in the context of historical averages. Therefore, the past historical record is often be seen as prologue as to what will happen in the future. This is linear thinking where scaling remains within fixed ratios. Contemplating event probabilities that are known to be distinctly nonlinear using linear thinking is apt to draw erroneous conclusions, because the underlying forces are differently scalable from what we experienced in the past.Within my lifetime we have gone from mechanical calculators to cloud-based supercomputers, with results in computational capacity and productivity that could not have been imagined 60 or 70 years ago. We are doing business in ways that were inconceivable and unattainable only a few decades ago, using instantaneous worldwide communications that accelerate the size and pace of commercial and financial transactions in real time and ways that far exceed our collective abilities to design and manage them. By virtue of our enhanced technologies, we have opened the door to effects of scale that could not have been contemplated when the institutions we created to manage the forerunners of those now-enhanced processes were created. We are figuratively 'the sorcerer's apprentice', playing with magic, using those newfound powers in ways that we can only guess at learning how to control, and which could do us all great harm if misused.Philosopher, teacher, writer (and former stock trader) Naseem Nicholas Taleb coined the phrase ‘Black Swan’ to describe those extremely rare events that for most purposes are ignored. In a power law distribution, the probability that an event will occur is proportional to its size raised to a negative exponent. The size of the power law’s exponent determines the likelihood and size of large events, meaning that the probability that the event will occur is inverse to its size; when the exponent equals 2, the probability of that event is proportional to the square of its size. For exponents of 2 or less, a power law distribution lacks a well-defined mean. The mean of data drawn from a power law distribution with an exponent of 1.5 never converges; it simply increases without limit. Thus, the larger the event, the less likely it is to occur; but if it does occur, the potential size of the event can be catastrophic. Decreasing frequency is coupled with exponentially larger magnitude of effect, with the obvious corollary that building robustness into the enterprise is a practical necessity. And yet, in the years since the debacle of 2008, what we have seen is increasing pressure to allow those who were responsible for the near collapse of the world economy, to behave much the same as they did before. Models such as those described above are supposed to be teaching tools; but apparently those who were in charge before have learned nothing from the event since then.Time and space do not allow for a broader exposition of Professor Page’s excellent analysis; but if the crisp and well-reasoned presentation he makes in his discussion of the effect of power laws on the probability of real-world events is to be taken at face value, the balance of his book is equally well done.Nevertheless, as with any work of substantial size and effort, the sheer weight of the output, inevitably leave patches here and there that would warrant reappraisal and updating in a future edition of this extraordinary book. Two points come to mind: in discussing Game Theory in chapter 21, Professor page does not elaborate on what competition between an established business firm and a new competitor seeking entry into the market would look like. This competition depends upon the ability of the competitors to differentiate themselves, in accordance with customer preferences, and which can be any of the following –• Price/price competition.• Price/quality competition.• Price/services.• Quality versus service, with price a dealbreaker.I cannot recommend Professor Page’s book too highly. If I could, I would tuck it into the book bag of every STEM student in high school and college undergraduate. I would also recommend it highly for students who do not have plans that include cultivating prowess in mathematics and science. In point of fact, I would use whatever strategy I could conjure up to induce non-science students to learn as much as they can from what Professor Page provides in his teaching syllabus. This material should be part of every high school curriculum, and educators owe it to their students and their parents to make this information, in some form, available to their students, because without it those students will be treading water getting nowhere, as the world they live in becomes overrun with data they are unable to use.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Model Thinker: What You Need to Know to Make Data Work for You
"I am giving this book five stars for the effort involved in wrtiing the book, .subtracting two stars for the double marketing hype in the titile and on the back; for a net rating of three stars. The hype is explained below.1. The book started as an introduction to modeling for social scientists. It achieves that goal. But an appropriate title  would ""An Introductory Handbook on Modeling for Social Scientists"".  That could be a five star book. Instead the marketing hypes at Basic Books introduced the buzz words ""Model Thinker"" and ""data"". Both topics are lightly treated in the book. Model thinking is all the rage because of the Charles Munger quotation of chapter one. But Munger's mental models are subtle and are rarely discussed well. An excellent treatment though is Peter Bevelin's  ""Seeking Wisdom from Darwin to Munger"". Using models to make data analysis possible is professionally described in Philipp Janert's  ""Data Analysis with Open Source Tools"".2. Turning now to the issues with the content of the book.  The book contains some twenty-five models in brief chapters averaging roughly 12 pages each. A wine tasting for models. What do you when you need a full case of vintage modeling for real world problem. You turn to the references where you may find a dedicated tome with a few hundred pages covering the same topic. Two examples are Ch. 10 on Network Models backed up by Mark Newman's treatise  and Ch 18 System Dynamics Models backed up by John Sterman's ""Business Dynamics "" Now these are two worthy books, and each could justify a year's course work, representing a large number of hours of effort. This brings me to the point of how much effort is required for each of the twenty-five models for a reasonable competence level to support a truly multi-model effort. Page touches this only lightly and not well.3. This introduces the subject of a major lack of the book: a methodology for integrating a set of models for a multi-modeling effort. A methodology is a theortetical system supporting the use of a set of methods, models in a field. A methodology can also guide the effort of additional learnings in a field to support a large application.  Fortunately the British have provided five decades of work on methodologies for wicked and messy problems in social systems. An entry into this literatue is provided by ""Rational Analysis for a Problematic World: Problem Structuring Methods ..."" edited by Jonathan Rosenhead and John Mingers, 2001. Note that the British cybernetics and soft system methodology schools treat social systems as human activity systems (HAS). Over decades this has proven to be powerful and fruitful approach.",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Model Thinker: What You Need to Know to Make Data Work for You
"I'm just an undergraduate computer science student (so take this review with a healthy dose of scepticism), but this is an excellent book on modelling both natural and social phenomena. Its philosophy is to use multiple models to describe a phenomena that the reader is interested in. The author discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each model, and the strengths and weaknesses of modelling in general.The author discusses rational and psychological models, the bell curve and power law distributions, linear regression, concave and convex functions, network models, entropy, epidemiological models, Markov chains, path dependence, and many other useful mathematical tools. The author acknowledges the weaknesses of models and does a great job giving a nuanced discussion of employing models with a healthy dose of scepticism and with value judgement. The book ends with an investigation into income inequality and opioids with a ""many-model"" approach and the author shows how the use of multiple models can be helpful when trying to understand something.I suppose that my only criticisms is that the author quotes authorities to bolster the usefulness of the model that they will discuss (personally, I think that it's better to quote authorities to disagree with them). Furthermore, I feel that the mathematical rigour is a bit lacking (though I do acknowledge that this book was written for people who don't necessarily have a strong maths background).Overall, I'd rate this book like a 4.3/5 stars. Amazing primer!",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Model Thinker: What You Need to Know to Make Data Work for You
"What's a model? How to use a model? Why to use a model? Any qualitative approach to apply a model? Only use 1 model or various? These are the questions that these book look to help to answer. It is fascinating as depending your area of expertise some model will be recognizable and others not. Maybe someone can say that many other models are not included, or not clear the difference what a model is, is the Standard Atomic model a ""model""? Not described here however it is. Same with many others. In any case it is very informative and overeating to understand the why: the more diverse approach to think about a problem, the better answers or guidelines you can get. Some are most difficult to apply unless further study or practice like bandit models or NK models in my case. What about machine learning? Algorithms are also a model? It is a super interesting book to start this thinking approach, and I recommend to do also his course in Coursera: Model Thinking. Ideally to read paired with Algorithms to Live by: different style, different Algorithms (or model?) But completes this vision of learning to apply formal models to analyze a problem and think on different potential solutions.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Model Thinker: What You Need to Know to Make Data Work for You
"In our era of voluminous data modeling is increasingly used to analyze and predict.  In ""The Model Thinker,"" author Scott Page takes the reader on a tour of some of the most common models used today, using examples that touch on areas such as world affairs and geopolitics, social networking, medicine, politics, sports, economics, and unusual occurrences. The author realizes and notes that no model is perfect, so he stresses the practice of using multiple models for any given problem in order to look at situations from different angles to obtain the best solution.The general reader will likely be familiar with many of the concepts used to illustrate the models such as game theory and bell-shaped normal distributions, and while the equations highlighted will likely be over the heads of those without undergrad math degrees, general readers will be able to follow Page's arguments and train of thought well enough to make ""The Model Thinker"" a worthwhile and informative read about the modeling process used to make more and more predictions and decisions in our time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Model Thinker: What You Need to Know to Make Data Work for You
"First of all, I bought this book thinking it was about far more complex models. I even have a hard time thinking of the models covered in this book as models, but rather as formulas, and mostly short ones at that. I did a little research and sure enough they are. A lot of work went into this book and it covers a lot of territory. Page warns us that most, if not all, of the formulas, excuse me, models, look at their subjects at a surface level and require a good deal more complexity to be really helpful. Instead, he recommends multi-modeling to gain more perspective. In other words, one over- simplified model isn’t as good as many over-simplified models. I’m not so sure. I think his most valuable advice is to use the modelling process as a step in the decision-making process, producing information that can inform a thoughtful decision making exercise. My experience is that this is true even with complex models. I know that game theory is very popular, but I found the discussion, not because of Page, to leave me wondering about their real value. I think the chapter on auctions could have been left out. The motivations of bidders, and sometimes those that hold auctions, is so complex that, in my opinion, it defies modelling.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Model Thinker: What You Need to Know to Make Data Work for You

The book is a primer on data science providing multiple techniques to analyse your data.Some parts felt repetitive while others felt like the author stepped outside his expertise. For example his view on financial bailout. The author argued that allowing AIG and other big banks to fail would be catastrophic while allowing Lehman wouldn’t. Has it occurred to him that Hank Paulson the architect behind the bailout was ex Goldman and was it coincidental that Merrill, Bear Stearns and Lehman, Goldman competitors would be allowed to fail? Also, regarding AIG profitable investment, isn’t it odd that a supposedly government profitable investment also reported losses and hasn’t met expectations ever since?

"If you want nice and tidy package of all the things you need to know to get ready to do great Data Science, then this is the book for you!Programming Skills for Data Science starts at the beginning of the DS journey. It takes you through the basics, careful to ensure that no tricky acronym or software 'gotcha' is left unexplained. Folks will appreciate the book's guiding hand which provides a consistent and carefully thought out introduction to all the tools and technologies you need to know. It starts with command line tools and git, making sure the reader is prepared for the more advanced stuff later in the book. I liked the inclusion on a chapter about using Markdown for documentation purposes. If you already are familiar with this markup language, its an easy thing to skim. But if you haven't used Markdown before, it is great to have it here, right in-line with the other prerequisites.The next section of the book provides a great introduction to R - a powerful and wildly popular tool for 'doing' data science. The way Mike Freeman and Joel Ross build up from simple programming concepts to advanced R features really showcase that they've been teaching this stuff for a long time - and have a system that works! I love the walkthrough of basic data types in R (which are kinda weird even if you are familiar with data types from other languages). I also appreciate the section on where one can find help. Thats one of the biggest lessons to learn when doing any programming work - its completely ok to search out answers when you get stuck. Mike and Joel provide a comprehensive list for doing just that.The main section of the book gets people comfortable with the primary tasks of a Data Scientist - wrangling and visualizing data using code. And here, Joel and Mike again show their expertise by picking the best-in-class packages for working with data in R today. Their showcasing of the 'tidyverse' of packages gets you parsing and working with data in the most direct and powerful way possible. They show you how to get started with ggplot2 for visualizing data quickly. I thought it was nice they include a quick description of the 'grammar of graphics' which is the conceptual framework ggplot2 is built from. There is even a section on making maps in R - using the same tools!The final section of the book on building and publishing data-driven reports and analyses really ties everything together. Their suggestions for building and publishing static and interactive analyses are really some of the best ways to get your work out there. I learned a lot of how to build out these interactive tools using Shiny - and make them look good too!Throughout the book I loved the writing style and the attention to detail. There are innumerable call-outs, tips, and warnings as you read. I love that they provide both Windows and Mac examples of setup and screenshots. And I love that the book comes in full color! So those graphics are easy to read and understand. I think a critique that could be leveled against this book is ""well can't you find this all on the Internet?"". But really, what book couldn't you say that about, these days? But it is true - there are resources out there that cover chunks of this material. You could probably amass a body of work that hit roughly the same topics. But a benefit of this book is having a single resource where all of this material is packaged for you in one handy-dandy guide, so you don't have to be constantly googling mystery words and trying to piece disparate narratives together while learning something new.This book is a great guide and a great resource  for starting down the Data Science path.

"While Freeman and Ross's Programming Skills for Data Science is a standout compilation of a variety of introductory data science topics, the value of the text is diminished by the authors' inability to fully articulate many of the nuances of data science.What is really great:1. An excellent spread of important topics that are often omitted from a data science text, but are skills that every data scientist should know, including git (for collaboration), markdown and bash.2. Elegant coding and plots.  Being an effective communicator cannot be understated and the care the authors take in providing beautiful code demonstrates their pedagogic expertise.3. A nice set of complementary exercises and code available on GitHub to practice your data science skill set.What isn't so great:1. Part of the challenge of data science is it encompasses so many topics and while the authors do try to include many references, when I finished the book, I felt that a number of noteworthy topics were not given any treatment whatsoever.  There was no mention of object oriented programming or computational complexity.  The data wrangling section seems a bit short and does not really get into how ugly a data set can be and what functions you need to clean it (e.g. drop duplicate records).  And perhaps worst of all, the authors bemoan the challenge of resolving package conflicts, but do not mention any potential solutions to help address these difficulties (like Docker).2. The examples at time tend to be very dry or misaligned with a data science textbook.  Seeing multiple toy references to data sets about people's height is painful.  Part of an introductory data science text is to inspire the reader regarding the versatility of the field and the lack of attention given to providing interesting data sets causes the text to lose some of its persuasive message.  (The constant focus on geospatial visualization is a bit too much at times as such plotting techniques are probably better for a more specialized text on geospatial data science.).3. Finally, the prose in Designing Visualizations and Understanding Data is a bit too dry or contradictory at times.  The Understanding Data section would be much better motivated by relating stories where not understanding the story behind the data led to disastrous consequences as opposed to just reiterating trite talking points (e.g. know your data).  Similarly, while most of the visualizations are absolutely stunning and the code to write them is very short and readable, they are sometimes cluttered with large or awkward font- a point the authors admit should be avoided when possible.Overall, I would certainly recommend this text to a colleague and I look forward to seeing future revisions of the text that hopefully will address some of the shortcomings listed above.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science Foundations Tools and Techniques (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)

"I recently got this book as a supplement to my learning R in a university system since my professor was not the best teacher. I must say I'm glad I found this book. Unlike many other coding books, it starts at the very beginning such as file management, text editors, the best IDEs, and project set up. After these topics it jumps into the typical computer science stuff like variables, data types, etc. It's hard to stress how nice it is for a book to be comprehensive in its approach to learning a computer programming language. Too many books forget that its a contextual process, and it's crucial to understand everything that goes along with simply just coding scripts and functions.The book goes over how to collect and manipulate data, how to visualize data, and how to build and share your applications. It goes over so many important concepts that I've found other books lack like accessing data from databases and web APIs, and it introduces many of the essential functions used for data analysis too. As someone who was personally interested in making maps with R, there are great examples of that too.The writing is clear and concise, the examples are fantastic, and the snippets of code are extremely helpful.

What is outstanding about this book is that all the important areas of basic R are covered (e.g. apply functions, dplyr and tidyr libraries) in what is a very short book (about 340 pages) that can easily be read in a week or two.

"This is a very useful, for the intuitive programmer or mathematician who can program in python already, book, as a lead into statistics. I found that though it gives concrete wisdoms on principles of working with data, the book seems to me heavily on the appreciation of information with cognizant memorization in mind. Or simply, I personally got bored and needed to write a bunch of memos towards the end of the book, to continue repeating what I felt I wasn't interested in, because it was easier than enough. Speaking of this, the pedagogy looks to me that it turns to the idea of repetition of learning along a spectrum or curve where one increments there ability to perform statistical processing of statistically calculable theoretical knowledge and significant intuitively in this respect.The book got too long in the amount of information I expected myself to remember, somewhat brief on theory, - so dense and this may be due to my lack of discipline. It is not a sparse book, or incapable of teaching.Rather, the book is incredibly utilizable of an introduction to auto-didactic gains, expedient in the moment one chooses to endure this encoded travail or. A great work from the author, able to let the user show with one's already experienced hands that they can get on the series objects integrable or otherwise. Cf what students have learnt already in algebra for series. This is a stats book so there's graphing and interpretations or cyphering of data as a very practicable path.editing at 11/11/2023: I took a break from this book for a while, because the code was too complicated, hoenstly.The truth I found out is after spending time with bill lubanovic's book 'introducing python: modern computing in simple packages', that the book does help with serious data skills such as: parsing code, understanding an argument as you read it, so understanding the topic (stats) in general, comprehension of OOP with statistics and visa versa.So with that in mind, I found out that I got the idea of it providing code w/ formula to snap tables (contemplatively or otherwise) comprehending textually as a colloquial pythonista based business logic. it clarifies it's position halfway through to boost conscientious intel (objects etc.). like, what can be safely done with data as a decision in your thought process etc? that's what I think it's useful for, as a statistic solution, which is helpful.but with theory, truthiness, and amenity enjoy pushing around data at a broad level.(before I had finished the book, but left half the problems to miscommunication (python fluency))",4.0 out of 5 stars,Think Stats: Exploratory Data Analysis
"I really liked this book. The author did a really good job. It's a mixture of Python and statistics so some previous background in both will allowing you to benefit entirely from reading this book. Especially prior experience with Python will help you understand the code used by the author, as it is not a simple one. He often uses wrapper functions and class inheritance, so if this doesn't ring a bell, I suggest learning a bit of Python first. Otherwise you can skip the programming parts, but I think you will lose a large part of the book's value.Statistics here is more basic than Python code, for sure. But it does serve well as a introduction to statistical analysis. A software developer wanting to start learning statistics is probably a good candidate for this book. But not the other way around. After reading it I think I still prefer to use R to generate probability density plot, than Python.Anyway, it is almost a must read for anyone on their patch to data scientist career.

"This book is a great introduction to statistics for any person with basic programming skills. The main issue, when you tackle any math-heavy stuff - is that you are bombarded with a huge amount of formulas, but can't ""feel"" the practical side of the subject.In this book, you have a simple way to practically and swiftly try each new concept through Jupyter Notebook interactive examples. Transform the data, draw a chart - observe results. The fastest feedback loop you can get learning any math stuff.If you want to get the best results from the book, spend some time and setup Jupyter Notebook, or just run them directly in Google Collab service. Just reading the book without practically running all the examples just a waste of time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Think Stats: Exploratory Data Analysis
"The book generally explains the concepts well, but could provide more details and more examples.  I found the code actually very hard to understand, because the function and variable names are often missing clarity.

"It pains me to think that trees died so this book could be printed.  The author has two primary topic elements (Python and statistics) and he misses on them both.  The discussion of statistics is insufficiently supported from a mathematical perspective and the Python is little more than a shameless plug for the author's own package.  Worse still, as other reviewers have pointed out, many of the functions in his package are pointless replications of already existing statistical functions.  Moreover, the wording of his text seems almost intentionally obfuscated to avoid telling readers there are pre-existing functions in common packages such as NumPy and matplotlib which make his function irrelevant. I purchased this book as it was required for a class, but I won't even resell it used because I am morally opposed to selling anything I already know to be so completely defective there is no way it can be of any use to the buyer.

"In an era of digital connectivity and the constant exchange of information, concerns regarding data privacy have become paramount. Amidst this backdrop, ""Data for All"" emerges as a seminal work that comprehensively explores the intricacies of data privacy and provides invaluable insights into this increasingly crucial subject matter.Written by John Thompson, an expert in the field and author of two previous books on data and AI that I also enjoyed, ""Data for All"" delves into the multifaceted aspects of data privacy with clarity and depth. From the moment I embarked on this read, I was again pleased by the author's ability to present complex concepts in an accessible manner, making it an ideal resource for beginners and seasoned privacy advocates.One of the book's most substantial merits is its systematic approach to the topic entwined with personal anecdotes that make the read enjoyable to those whose primary responsibility isn't data governance & privacy policy specifically. Each chapter is organized and tackles specific aspects of data privacy, such as historical implications, technological realities, expectations of trust, and ethical considerations. By adopting this structure, the author ensures that readers gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter while also being able to delve into specific areas of interest, all without losing the non-expert journeyman in the process.Moreover, the book is replete with real-world examples and cases illustrating the consequences of easy data access and the potential impact on individuals and society. These examples serve as cautionary tales, emphasizing the urgency of protecting our personal information in an increasingly interconnected world. The author successfully bridges the gap between theory and practice by grounding the discussion in real-world scenarios.Another noteworthy aspect of ""Data for All"" is its forward-looking approach. Recognizing the ever-evolving nature of technology and its impact on privacy, the author explores emerging trends. By doing so, the book not only offers insights into current challenges but also equips readers with the knowledge necessary to navigate the landscape of the future with regard to their data.Further, the author does an exceptional job of addressing the ethical dimensions. By analyzing the balance between individual data privacy expectations with both corporate and societal benefits, the book encourages readers to contemplate the implications of data collection, processing, perpetual storage, and utilization. This thought-provoking exploration ensures that ""Data for All"" transcends mere technicality and elevates the discussion to a philosophical level.In conclusion, ""Data for All"" is a quick and easy read and an indispensable resource that explores data privacy with surprising depth and clarity without wasting the reader's time. Combining a systematic approach, real-world examples, and an examination of emerging technologies and ethical considerations, the book establishes itself as a great place to start for a concerned citizen, a parent worried about their kid's exposure, or as a catalyst for developing thought-leading experts in the field. Regardless of your background or level of expertise, this thought-provoking book will undoubtedly enlighten and empower you to navigate the intricate realm of data privacy. It is an essential addition to the library for anyone who values their privacy and seeks to understand and protect their personal information.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data for All
"I find it odd that Amazon, asked me, the author to write a review.  Let's see if this posts to the site.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data for All
"What's most impressive about the book is John himself; the breadth of experience and actual insights that John uses as examples in this cultural-data book alone make it worth the read because it proves he knows what he's talking about it. The problem with a book like this is that it's old within about 6 months to a year since many of the examples, whether backward looking or forwards looking, have been replaced with better ones. But John starts it off in the right place: ""Wake up people"" and finishes it off with an honest stab at what the prospective future state of data usage in our culture/society could look like. It's worth a read for any data professional and anyone interested in the bitcoin revolution. Why I mark it down a star is because like many, especially college textbooks, it's a bit verbose and repeats itself without actually making a new claim. This is also the blight of philosophical texts, which this leans towards. The flow is also a bit choppy, but this is somewhat of a preference. I liked the diversity of chapters and themes and he provides useful examples. It could have benefited from further discussion on digital currency and how that would integrate with other conceptual (at this point) frameworks like the data intermediaries. I would say the best information is pragmatic: get off the FANG companies. get on the do-not lists, and disconnect for a while until the collective ""we"" can figure out how to get you a data dividend, or passive income stream from your data usage. This is book that should have come out before the dot-com era, but I'm glad it exists.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data for All
"This is a great companion book for anyone and any organization. Period! Not simply ""any of those dealing with lots of data"", but any of those! That's because confronting data daily is no longer an option or a choice, just like we don't have an option whether the sun will rise and set tomorrow, nor do we have a choice of what kind of star we have for the Sun in our solar system. It's there. Get used to it. Work with it. And benefit from it. Solar power anyone? Data power anyone? In fact, the book starts with an enjoyable little ""complete this sentence"" exercise: ""Data is the new..."". My top 3 favorites are: Data is the new currency. Data is the new future. Data is the new sun. There's that solar/data power thing again — as it should be! The reusable, non-depleting, and nearly inexhaustible number of use cases of data should get everyone excited with the many facets, features, benefits, and profitability dimensions of data. This book will take you on that journey, open your eyes to your own data, inspire data and analytics innovation, and deepen your appreciation of data trust, privacy, and monetization.When I said ""companion"" book in my opening statement, I meant that there will be many other books that one will need for the data journey, including books specifically on analytics (business, health, sports, cyber,...), data science, machine learning, coding, AI, internet of things, cybersecurity, marketing, future of work, etc. that will serve specific purposes. But this book ""Data for All"" is a great companion to all those. One of the reasons for this is the great emphasis throughout this book on data trust, privacy, and ownership (TPO). While there are many sources written on TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), the thorough coverage (cover-to-cover) of TPO in this book is a welcome perspective. These discussions are blended into the essential applications of data highlighted in the book, along with the important dimensions of data (such as data literacy, lineage, exchanges, intermediaries, and public perception). While covering these diverse topics, the book happily does not wander off-topic or diminish its major focus on the theme expressed in the book's title: Data for All.This book is well worth a place in your data library! It truly is the data book for all.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data for All

"To give a quick summary, this book is important.  John gives a high-level view of why understanding data and your place as a data product affects you.  He also gives a low-level view of the data ecosystem, trust, and privacy.  Basically, your data is used to manipulate you and make money. Be informed: read this book!Still with me?  Good.  This book is for you.  I don't know who you are, but you need to read this.  You're obviously online reading this right now and it's being noted.  What you look at, what you photograph, where you are, how you're moving, who you talk to...  It's a data-driven world out there you're probably not in the driver's seat.I have worked on data for decades and I have learned a lot from this book.  Not because I am bad at my job, but because there is so much to know.  Do you trust who has your data?  For that matter, do you even know who has your data?  How much do you care about your privacy?  Your family's privacy?John didn't write this book to scare you.  He wrote it to help you.  He has spent his entire career thinking about data and how it's used.  This is the data book we all need but people don't think about.  Just like books on personal finance, everyday communication, or critical thinking.  This is a book I want my wife to read; she's a computer science teacher who teaches about data privacy.  This is a book I want our parents to read.  These are topics I want to teach my own son to protect him.You honestly have two choices:  know your place as a data product and get shuffled around or take better control and make your data work for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data for All
"Author John Thompson takes the readers through the use of data from the early days to the present. The most important theme of this book is the focus on the individual while still connecting it to the larger ecosystem. John connects individuals' data to companies that use and benefit from data while articulating how regulations are underway. John differentiates between the metadata and data (such as when the caller called and from where and the call transcript) and how it might be possible to connect data and metadata at times. He argues for the right to privacy and how the world can move from its current state to a more advanced one where individuals participate in the data journey rather than just giving it away.The book benefits from excellent secondary research and details data laws by state and jurisdiction. The book also mentions data usage hierarchy. One notable mention is how data is used to simulate systems, inform underlying system dynamics, and use digital twins; however, the book's primary focus is appropriately on, as the title suggests, ""Data for all.""Overall, the book provides an excellent narrative on the importance of individuals' data privacy within the larger data ecosystem. It rightly prods individuals to have a say in managing their data — a must-read with a forward from Tom Devenport, one of the eminent thought leaders in this field.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data for All

Many do not understand how our data  (Personal Work, Health, Financial, Online browsing and purchasing, social relationships etc. etc.) is captured, used and shared, leveraged to control and exploit our behavior in every aspect as we go thru our life journey.  Do you know where your data is, who is using it, in what ways, sharing it with whom...? answer is No. John lays out in his book answers to all these questions and more, and offers solution options for us to manage our own data and OWN it.

"This is an excellent book on categorical analysis. My advice to anyone planning to use this book is to study the first 4 chapters very carefully and very thoroughly. These chapters form the heart of the analysis, and describe the tests that follow in the most general setting. After the first 4 are done, go through chapters 5 and 6, and you will realize that logistic regression is a special case of the results you have already learned. The rest of the book is best used as a reference (in my opinion) and one can look into the relevant sections as needed.The 2  important things reading this book has taught me to look for are (1) the role of cofounders in categorical analysis (see the example in section 2.3.2 for an illustration) and (2) effective groupings, when one of the entries in the contingency table is scarce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Categorical Data Analysis (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)

"This is a nice, simple, and comprehensive introduction on how to go about doing Machine Learning in R programming environment and I would have definitely recommended it for beginners were it not for the incredibly high number of either minor typos or just outright wrong text included in this book. There are pages where the author is saying one thing, while the code and the results are showing something else. In some places, the author refers to Appendix for additional statistical details, but there is no such Appendix to be found. As a beginner myself, I spent many minutes self-flagellating over why I didn't understand something that was obvious to the author before I realized that there was an error in the book. If you were to buy this book, I would recommend that you code along and not rely on the outputs shown in the book.

"This book very nicely introduces basic machine learning concepts like regression, decision trees, and neural networks and how to easily build, train, and evaluate models in R. In the final chapter, the author ties everything together nicely by showing how to tie everything together using the excellent caret package.The overall information is fantastic. However, this book has a surprising number of errors. These were mostly instances where the text showed one value, but the sample output showed another, perhaps due to code being re-run without using the same random seed. There were also instances where figure references were wrong. Although they didn't hurt my ability to learn, they were a big distraction, and could make things difficult for someone new to R or to ML.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Machine Learning with R: Rigorous Mathematical Analysis

"The book structure is very good, it introduces different class of ML techniques (supervised/unsupervised/mixed) and for each explain the main concepts. It is based mainly on the CARET package, which for now (Feb 2020) is the best option for ML in R. I also liked the fact that the author chose to use only the R-base package rather than the Tidyverse, so that everything can be understood withouth assuming previous knowledge. I think that to begin with ML using R this is definitely a book to have on the shelf...However, the amount of typos is annoying. The code ouput is often different from the one explained (see picture for an example). Being a book for beginners the fact the a confusion matrix cannot be accurately explained makes it hard to confidently go through the more complex parts. It's a good book, but it definitely needs to be revised. I would recommend to wait for the second edition.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Machine Learning with R: Rigorous Mathematical Analysis
"First of all, this is NOT a good book to learn R if you are a beginner. It assumes a basic knowledge of R but still goes through a lot of the basics. It does not attempt to teach a broad coverage of the language. For example, it has nothing on flow control, which makes sense since this deals with the statistical packages already in R so it doesn't cover how to actually write your own programs in R(if you want to do that, ""R For Dummies"" is an excellent introduction). So, this book sticks to what it is advertised to do: statistics. Does it cover an enormous amount of topics? No, after all, statistics is very vast. It covers such things as linear models, one and two way anova and contrasts in anova, for example. It doesn't cover topics in psychometry(which R can handle very nicely), like Cronbach's Alpha. So, this book is not encyclopedic, but you can see what it covers and what it doesn't before you buy it. No one source is going to give you everything in the R language. This book is an excellent source for what it does cover. Don't assume that just because it is part of the ""For Dummies"" series that it is super basic. There are many detailed, intricate books in the series. The series also includes many other books on R so, you might consider starting a collection!One other good point with this book: it is very recent so it includes the use of R Studio(as well as how to install it) which makes using R a bit more pleasant.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Analysis with R For Dummies (For Dummies (Computers))
"The book has a noble goal of teaching  statistical analysis with R programming. The book nicely demonstrates the graphing capabilities of the software.

I am not sure that this is a good book for beginning reader who is learning statistics or for someone starting to learn R.  More excercises, databases, and simpler code are needed for the text to be a useful to a beginner.  I had some problems with the code as written on page 151. If I moved the geom_segment  code to right after the geom_line code I stopped getting error messages in the console. I might add be very  careful with all the + signs and their location  in the arguments for ggplot for this code sample.

"The 5th edition of “Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data Analysis: Concepts and Applications” is a new, revised and expanded version of this PK/PD Bible that has been widely used for many years. It is valuable both as a text-book for beginners and as a reference book for more experienced scientists. The book contains numerous figures illustrating concepts and models.The first 3 Chapters cover general principles and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic concepts. The 4th Chapter discusses modeling strategies and ends with a checklist for assessing goodness-of-fit for models. Chapter 5 discusses elements of design for kinetic and dynamic studies and what data and design are needed to answer specific questions. Chapter 6 is entirely new and is my favorite since it deals with pattern recognition and the value of actually looking at data and curve shape as diagnostic tools for proposing mechanisms and improving data analysis and linking data to actual biological processes.The second half of the book contains applications and case studies and the data sets are supplied on an attached USB memory stick. There are 53 PK case studies, including a few with large molecules (antibodies and enzyme), and 52 PD case studies. All exercises start with the objectives for the exercise, continue with a problem specification, describes the study design and data, the models used (with references to the concept chapters) and ends with a section on the interpretation of results and conclusions. These exercises are clearly indexed and start off with simple PK studies such as single dose bolus i.v. or p.o. studies and continue with more complex examples. There is also an excellent overview Table in Chapter 1, listing the case studies and the concepts on which they build.I strongly recommend this book to everybody working in this fieldYlva Terelius, PhD, Distinguished ScientistStockholm, Dec 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data Analysis: Concepts and Applications, Second Edition"

The material is well organized and easy of access.A very little mathematics is necessary to understand the matter. What I really like is the possibility to find without loss of time the model you need.The book covers a wide range of models used (and useful) in PK/PD modeling, linear as well as non-linear. One distinctive property of the text is the complete description and clear explanation of  all the models.What I really miss is the lack of comparative description of easy acceptable software for PK/PD modeling.

That's exactly what the book delivers.The problem, as some reviewers have mentioned, is that the setup script that comes with the book requires you to have a Windows machine. I have a mac, and I found it incredibly time consuming and frustrating to get it to work.As other reviewers apparently did, I eventually stumbled upon the book's webiste where you can pay extra to get a MySQL version of the startup script. And a MySQL version of the exercises (there are some name differences).I would give the book 5 stars based on the content. But paying extra for what I really needed at the start rubs me the wrong way. I think that there should probably be a separate version of the book on Amazon for MySQL, and it should cost the same as this MS SQL version.As things stand now, I wound up paying 2x the list price for the book so I could use it.

"Background: I have a basic understanding of SQL b4 reading this book (aka I knew some SQL keywords like SELECT, FROM, INSERT, DELETE, CASE... although I never wrote SQL scripts myself).  I'm fairly good at programming in Java and have dabbled in python, js, linux command line/bash, selenium, cucumber and android. I consider myself intermediate in CSy stuff / programming / software engineering.Intermediate: If you are intermediate, I suspect you can complete this book in 16hrs (one weekend, 8hrs each day).  I'd highly recommend not looking at the hints or solutions at all until you've solved the problem.  Instead, effectively search for a solution online if you do not know how to complete the specified problem.Beginner: On the other hand, if you are a beginner to CS things in general, this book will take much longer (and be marginally more beneficial).  I'd recommend reading the problems, hints and solutions and make sense of them, write notes, look up functions etc over one weekend (estimating 8hrs each day) and then take a week off.  During the week off, read wiki articles about SQL, different versions of SQL, relational database theory etc.  Return to this book and set a goal of 5 problems daily devoting maybe 1 hr daily for those 12 days and this time do not look at hints/solutions until after you've got a working solution yourself (use the internet to search for solutions).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"SQL Practice Problems: 57 beginning, intermediate, and advanced challenges for you to solve using a “learn-by-doing” approach"
"Kudos to Ms. Vasilik for developing a valuable product. My SQL querying skill prior to purchasing this book was, at best,  intermediate. I also was not familiar with some newer SQL Server functions (e.g. CTE, Windows functions), having not used the SQL language for several years. As a result, I was forced to perform a bit of on-line research to solve the problems. That was OK; Google is your friend. To benefit from this book, effort is definitely required. It is not a SQL manual that one occasionally references for syntax or examples. Rather, it is the closest substitute for taking a SQL querying class. I learned quite a bit. Repetition is the key. One can know SQL syntax, but still not know how to methodically approach and resolve a problem. I felt this book enhanced my skill in answering various types of real world data questions by forcing me to think rather than feeding me the solutions.

"R in Action does an excellent job showing the power of the R language. The book also serves a way to learn statistics and data science through using the R language.At the beginning the examples are practical, showing how to make graphs based off data sets that come packaged with R. Sometimes packages are required to install to get the examples running, and the author is clear about how to do this.In chapter eight there was an excellent description about Regression analysis. I knew what regressions were, but this explanation helped clear up some confusion I had. The author says (p.167): ""It's [regression analysis] a broad term for a set of methodologies used to predict a response variable (also called a dependent, criterion, or outcome variable) from one or more predictor variables (also called independent or explanatory variables).Following this explanation is a concrete example given showing how to predict the number of calories a person burns on a treadmill based off different factors. I liked that the author defined all the terms, and then gave a concrete example. It is a pattern throughout the book that worked very well.The later parts of the book briefly dive in machine learning and more advanced data science concepts.The main focus of the book is on statistics, graphing, and plotting. This worked well, because it shows the areas where R shines compared with other languages. Luckily for the reader the author knows which techniques work well, and states when certain data analysis techniques work better than others. The author remains humble throughout, stating when he finds a topic complex.R in Action is a great resource for learning R and learning statistics.

"I have read quite a few books on R, and will rate this as perhaps one of the best if not the best. The author has explained the material with excellent clarity, the examples are relevant to real-world applications, and the code executes well using either base installation of R (with added packages) or R studio. Also, the author has managed to concurrently develop both data analysis and data visualization (graphing), which helps the reader, and exposes the capabilities of R very well. The range of topics covered in this book is very broad and gives a good overview of the field. As a clinician with interest in epidemiology, I found almost everything needed for beginner or intermediate level applications. Also, if one works through this book diligently, s/he will be in a very good position to follow more advanced topics (like multilevel models) from other resources.I have only one issue with the book (which is a generic issue with most statistics or data science books centered around a software). That is, it contains very little, if any, mathematical basis or details of the methods being discussed. These days, statistics is taught ""thorough"" a software. Hence, it is artificial to separate mathematical statistics from computational aspects. I am waiting for a book which will start with the mathematical aspects including derivations of the theorems/equations, give examples of real world applications, and illustrate the application in R.One minor issue is related to very poor quality of the binding of the book. In the copy that I received, perhaps the pasting was defective, and as soon as I first opened it, the first page tore off. Soon, the binding opened up and pages/sections started falling off. I am not sure if this is just limited to the copy that I got or is a systemic issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars,R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R

"Overall quite a fan and recommend the book! I am a graduate student who was struggling with some analyses, and this provided a great overview on the code + logic behind the analyses in a way that helped me get what I needed to do done quickly (quicker than looking up internet sources). Seems like it's going to be a great reference to have on hand at all times when putting R into practice with research. The one thing (thus far) I am disappointed with is that the code for graphs isn't complete -- frequently will say that the following code produces graph #xyz. However, the code really only produces the most basic version of the graph in the book, and they don't include the extra code for ACTUALLY reproducing (which would be handy if new to graphs and trying to figure out some basic formatting manipulations without a lot of work)",5.0 out of 5 stars,R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R

The author does a great job explaining statistical concepts. I would recommend this book to practitioners and teachers alike for that reason. Those focusing on statistical analysis (statistics) or data mining would enjoy this book. It doesn't cover more advance concepts in-depth like some books I have read, but that isn't this book's goal.

I wish I had a book similar to this one years ago.  The author *clearly* explains topics and provides worked examples.  An item I'd like to see in the introductory section: creating a basic script that provides a graphical output and running it from a command prompt.  I have this situation right now: I'm running a script on a Mac that generates a .png output; the output quality is poor compared to cut-and-paste from the GUI.  Another item:  how to run a command script on a Windows machine.I highly recommend this book.,5.0 out of 5 stars,R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R

"I have a strong interest in information security and quantitative research, so people who know me in person could imagine how giddy I felt when I came across this book... especially since it was published by the No Starch Press! It's a great introduction and I learnt about a lot of neat statistical concepts reading this book: like Jaccard's index, n-grams, ROC curves, decision boundaries, network analysis with Python, visualisation, and a lot more.The book also came with a lot of practical exercises where the reader can analyse malware on a virtual machine. I did not do all the exercises, so this review may be a bit biased regarding some of the criticisms.I feel that the authors could have given a more rigourous treatment of machine learning constructs (the exception to this is their discussion of deep learning in chapters 10 and 11). But given that this is an introductory book for infosec analysts, they might be laying off the mathy bits as to not intimidate them, so it's understandable. Also, the reference for disassembly with Python and dynamic analysis with Cuckoo Sandbox seems light, so I feel that they could have expanded on that.Other than that, this was a great introduction to the interdisciplinary study of cybersecurity and statistical analysis. Would definitely recommend it as it can be both easy to understand for the beginner and challenging for the seasoned analyst.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Malware Data Science: Attack Detection and Attribution
"As a data scientist and machine learning practitioner I was disappointed in this book.  Admittedly the authors faced the very difficult task of trying to communicate the relationship of two very deep and technical subjects: malware analysis and machine learning.  The result, unfortunately, is a work that is only the barest introduction to both.The first half of the book dips a toe in the ocean of malware static analysis, dynamic analysis, and reverse engineering.  Not knowing anything about malware, this section of the book did indeed spark my curiosity and supply me with strong motivation to continue my studies in malware analysis with other, more comprehensive resources.The second half of the book is a shallow overview of basic, elementary topics in machine learning and common tools used by practitioners.  This overview is accompanied by proof-of-concept applications to malware detection.  The machine learning overview will not supply any new knowledge to anyone who has any practical experience in machine learning and for a complete beginner it is insufficient even as a first course.In summary, this is not a bad book as the authors are clearly technically proficient, good writers, and passionate about their area of expertise.  Nonetheless, be aware that if you are not already an expert in malware AND machine learning you will need to follow up this short read with much more detailed sources.  If you are already proficient in both subjects than you will already understand how to apply machine learning to malware analysis to the level of basic examples found in this book.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Malware Data Science: Attack Detection and Attribution

"This is a serious book for serious people.  If you are a newbie to econometrics, look elsewhere.  But then, if you were a newbie, you probably would not be reading reviews for this book.Anyway, this volume is the leading and, in my view, the best treatise on econometrics involving panel data.  I worked through various chapters of it as part of a Ph.D. level class on advanced econometrics.  (No, I have not read the entire book, and I have never met anyone who claimed that (s)he did.)This book requires(1) a solid grounding in linear algebra (""matrices"")(2) a very solid grounding in econometrics(3) a very substantial amount of spare timeOn the plus side, the author has a skill for elegant and clear writing.  He is also one of the leading experts on many of the topics covered, and it shows.  For many of the topics, I have not been able to find a clearer and more useful treatment elsewhere.On the downside, you will occasionally have to consult other materials as well, especially research papers.  This should not surprise you.  If you are interested in econometrics at the level covered in this treatise, then you know that econometrics is an evolving science, and you can never get the absolute cutting-edge research from any treatise.  However, my advice is: Use this treatise as your go-to resource and then delve into the most recent papers for the topics that your research focuses on.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, second edition (The MIT Press)"
"Wooldridge gives enough detail for the intellectual student to fully understand the underlying basis of the theory. The material is concise enough to be simple to the eye, yet (as long as one can read linear algebra), steps left out do not take long to work out by hand. Having read ""Introduction to Econometrics"" before this, Wooldridge is my preferred choice of author, as I find it easy to understand his writing. I consider a work such the present one to be essential background knowledge for the practicing econometrician.All the topics relevant to cross-sectional data are included (OLS, FGLS, dealing with heteroskedasticity or serial correlation, IV, MLE, probit/logit models, etc.), in a more rigorous way than ""Introduction to Econometrics"", in addition to panel topics. Linear algebra is used to simplify the notation.Compared to more elementary texts, the typography is more bland and traditional, but that's probably because the target audience is narrower and more serious. A Times serif font is used for both the text and the math.I can't say much now about what material is omitted, but I'll see if I can update this review in a few years' time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, second edition (The MIT Press)"

I highly recommend PhD students in econ and finance (and other quantitative disciplines) buying the copy, as the 1st edition pdf available online is not the same.

This book is invaluable for someone who already has a good understanding of econometrics and wants a lot of detail and guidance in one place.  I wouldn't want to live without it.

Great,5.0 out of 5 stars,SQL for Data Analytics: Perform fast and efficient data analysis with the power of SQL
"Frankly, this book is trash. I bought it to teach myself some extra SQL and data analytics with it but what I received was an introductory SQL text with very little data analytics.There are errors located everywhere in the book to the point where I'm sure you can find at least one every couple of pages. They range from simple typos, to typos in code you're supposed to copy, and to things that are just plain wrong.Along with the errors the figures in the book are a joke. There are multiple figures that take up almost an entire page when they have no right to. An example is in the first chapter they show a scatter plot with an upward trend to cover what correlating data looks like and it took up almost the entire page. It's a scatter plot with data that doesn't matter, you don't need an entire page just enough room for the reader to clearly see what's going on. It's something a student would do to pad their page count. Other reviews said their figures were blurry but thankfully the pictures in my copy are fine... just really big.The book was written by three different authors, and it really shows. You can definitely see a style change around halfway through the book. The first part of the book also focuses on using pgAdmin and the second half focuses purely on using a command prompt. Both are fine don't get me wrong, but the shift was sudden and seems like there wasn't much collaboration between the authors. The formatting of the queries you write is also all over the place and in my opinion teaches bad habits. The first author refuses to indent anything, the second writes queries in a better manner and the third writes entire queries on one line in the command prompt throwing legibility out the window.There's a section that introduces how to use SQL with python which was nice and I was looking forward to but the chapter is short and moves back to using the command prompt the next chapter. They also cover how to use JOINs twice for whatever reason. once towards the start and once towards the end.Maybe I'm misunderstand what data analytics is/contains but there isn't much besides basic concepts in this book. If you just want to count things, find the average, organize data then okay you will get that. Anything more advanced though is out of scope for the book and you are recommended to pick up another statistics book.I did learn some new things from this book, but they don’t spend to much time on some of the more advances subjects. I wouldn’t recommend this book to anyone, it seems like it was lazily put together by the authors and I’m sure you’d be better off with some other book.",1.0 out of 5 stars,SQL for Data Analytics: Perform fast and efficient data analysis with the power of SQL
"The book itself if very helpful BUT I strongly encourage the authors to take time to revise the Index when it is printed again.  The Index is near to useless.  We get reference books like this to learn the details of code and to look up questions as we are working with the code.  This involves referring to the Index.  It seems that creating the Index was rushed - perhaps the authors created it themselves instead of having someone who knew what they were doing create it?  In any case, you find something like the word ""Select"" and then 42 (!) pages or page combinations where this word appears.  Did that help?  Not at all, unless you want to look through 42 different page references.  As a matter of fact, the entire Index is only 4 pages total which should say something in itself.  Other than this, I think the book will be helpful BUT I need a decent Index to get the most use out of it.

Good,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"The book begins with the basics of the Python language in a chapter entitled ""A Crash Course in Python.""  Grus recommends the Anaconda distribution of Python 2.7, as do I.  It is free, includes Python, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and IPython that are used in the book, and includes pandas which we will use to handle financial data.  This is not the book I would recommend for a person new to Python to learn the language, but it establishes the style and notation used for the remainder of the book.Chapters 4, 5, 6 are quick reviews of linear algebra and the Python data structures used, frequentist statistics, and probability, respectively.  Chapter 7 discusses hypothesis and inference, and has a nice discussion of the beta distribution and its use in describing the ""prior"" distribution for Bayesian analysis.Chapter 8 begins to get into the data science with a description of the gradient descent method of finding the set of parameter values that maximize (or minimize) the objective function.  The ""from scratch"" approach shows all the details.Chapter 10, Working with Data, begins with methods for exploring the data.  Examining the distribution, plotting single dimensional data, comparing multiple data series, normalizing, rescaling, and dimensionality reduction.Chapter 11 begins machine learning -- models, overfitting, underfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, and feature extraction.Chapter 12 continues with k-nearest neighbors and the curse of dimensionality.Chapter 13 illustrates naive Bayes to implement a spam filter.Chapters 14 and 15 treat linear regression and multiple regression, fitting a model to data, and regularization to limit the tendency to overfit.Chapter 16 explains the logistic function and logistic regression.  Examples look at measures of goodness of fit.  The concept of support vector machine is explained, although the mathematics are beyond from scratch.Chapter 17 has a nice explanation of decision trees (the models that result from rule-based trading system development, such as AmiBroker).  Entropy, as it applies to information content, is well explained and used to partition data as the rules are created.  Random forests, one of the ensemble techniques for machine learning, is described in surprisingly concise code.Neural networks are described in chapter 18, including code for a feed forward, back propagation network that identifies digits.  The interpretation of the weights of each of nodes gives insight into the workings of neural networks.The book continues on with discussions of clustering, natural language processing, network analysis, recommender system, and databases.While this is not the best book to learn Python, machine learning, or model development, it is valuable in explaining each of these topics with fully disclosed logic and computer code.This book gets five stars based on meeting its objectives -- to clearly illustrate some of the central concepts of data science.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, one of my favorite books ever on programming. It does three things superbly: covers the basic low level tools of a data scientist (the ""from scratch"" part), gives a great overview of useful Python programming examples for those new to Python, and gives an amazingly succinct yet high level overview of the mathematics and statistics required for data science.At first I was very worried about this book based on the first few chapters for the one reason that the author was cracking jokes throughout the text and I thought if it kept up for the rest of the book I was going to be very upset. But it did not happen and it turns out to have been a very reasonable way to ease into this complicated subject.The author steps through the toolbox of the data scientist, chapter by chapter, giving useful, insightful, clear pieces of code and textual explanations of each topic. So, for those new to data science it gives just enough to get the basic idea of a concept in terms of code and mathematical explanation, and then moves on to the next topic.It is often said that in writing, less is better and this book gets things down to their essence. That is one of the great things about the book - that the length of each chapter is about 20 pages (over 25 chapters). So each chapter can be read and the code even exercised in about an hour. Further, the references at the end of each chapter invite the reader to expanded information at the level of one or more entire textbooks or references. Thus the book can be seen as kind of boiling down a 25-volume set of highly technical subject matter into roughly 300 pages.The topics that were explored the best seem to be the ones on probability, working with data, regression, clustering, and databases (SQL). Some of the small but dense code samples were tough to follow but that is based on their algorithmic complexity - such as that for logistical regression and MapReduce. Occasionally the author uses a term that is not defined or in the index (such as data munging - which I still haven't looked up to see what it means). There are only a small number of typos which indicates good editing. While the Python crash course was pretty good, Python is a vast language and there could have been more to that section.I read this book from cover to cover and stepped through logically all the code (but did not actually run any of it) and I would wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone wanting to work in the area of data science or its related fields, such as big data engineering or data analysis.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"+1 for concise and to the point.+1 for relevant topics.-1 for lack of real life library usage.-1 for lack of real world data.-1 NaN^ 2/5 stars.I don't normally leave reviews. I buy books, read them, and put them away. I decided to make an exception for this one.Before I go any further I'll give the benefit of the doubt that perhaps I had a misunderstanding of what this book was about. I am a data scientist who works in cyber security. I have been through a good amount of data science boot camps, books, and online training. They all have one thing in common. For being about ""data"" they all have pretty useless and unrealistic examples. This book is no exception. (I laughed at a part where the author literally says something similar to ""real life data is usually very messy"" and continues to not use real data).I will start out with the good parts about this book. It gives you a good crash course into Python and pretty much every critical data science concept. It is concise and filled with code examples written from scratch with little to no libraries being used (which is also a bad thing, I will explain shortly). The flow of the book is well designed as well.Now for the bad.1. Pure Python is great, but should be kept at a minimum. Sure, it gives you a good understanding of how to implement a concept in pure Python, but that is not the industry standard whatsoever. There should have been a healthy amount of real world implementations to offset the typical college classroom feel to the book. It also tends to add too much filler to the content. It would have been much better if it was ""read resource X to see how to implement this in pure Python"" and not ""read book X to see how to use a real world library to do this.""2. The data in this book is like all the data everyone uses in their examples. Completely useless. Randomly generated numbers, endless usage of the ""coin flip"" probability examples, typical artificial data that, I promise you, nobody analyzes on a daily basis. The book starts off with you role playing as a new data scientist for a fictional social networking platform for Data Scientists. Which was very promising start and I was eager to see how this ""character"" would deal with the data problems they would face... Spoiler, barely ever spoke about it. Most examples are riddled with typical Statistic 101 and randomly generated data. Yet again, another disappointment on that end.Maybe I misunderstood what this book was about. I could be wrong. That being said, I am now afraid to touch another ""Data Science"" book or online resource because I am sufficiently tired of reading about 300 ways to solve a problem with np.random generated arrays then turning to my screen with real world data and literally looking like the Persian Room Cat Guardian.I am not sure if I recommend this or not. It is a good book in the sense that you learn about what Data Science ""contains"" but definitely not how it applies to the real world.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"Although this book describes itself as a first step, I actually bought it as a second.  Let me explain.  I have taken online MOOC course's in Data Science / Machine Learning and have done well.  The problem has been is that they develop some large assignment and given you little windows to insert code (often Matlab / Octave) into.  Their code does the major lifting.  They give you a pat on the back telling you how wonderful you are for filling the wholes, but you leave unsatisfied knowing you could never have done it on your own.  So that is why I picked up this book. I wanted a basic book that could help me start to write code to attack simple problems on my own.I rarely like reviews that give first impressions, but I feel I must so that you get a better idea just what the author has done so far.  The goal of the book is to describe everything from scratch, and that is exactly what has been done.  No libraries - yep, no libraries.  Every single probability and statistic routine is built from scratch.When I picked up this book, my thought was that the author was addressing the data science routines  as found in sickout-learn only.  When we get to the data science, I would like to be applying python probability and statistic routines and not using the routines developed by the author. For a book this size, too many pages are devoted to basic probability and statistics.  Clearly this is not an attempt to teach this the first time, and he has already shown basic python, so we don't need more coding lessons.  And for someone who knows the material, I find some of the explanations confusing.  I would have liked a few basic examples using built in python functions to solve the problems.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"Minus one star for using outdated Python 2.7. Essentially ALL data science tools you are likely to run across have been updated to Python 3.4+. I would have knocked off two stars but this book is actually quite good and delivers on its title.This is a very basic book on Data Science but it gives a broad overview which helps you get a perspective on the tools that are available. This book teaches methods by developing actual code for these methods. You will find in work situations that you will use library functions instead of ""rolling your own"" but this book helps bring the details together by having you actually code these techniques. I support this approach 100% Once you have this overview, you can drill down into specifics with other materials like textbooks or cookbooks.I'd did flinch at some of the explanations in this book but it really is a ""from Scratch"" approach and some things are simplified to avoid distractions.This book also teaches basic Python 2.7 with a quick start chapter, so it is self contained for any scientist or engineer that wants to get started adding Data Science techniques to their repertoire.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"As a python programmer interested in learning applications of data science, I was really excited to come across this book.  Unfortunately what I expected to get out of this book and what I eventually got were not quite in line with one another.My expectation for this book was that it would give a good overview of how to apply statistical libraries in Python (NumPy, scikit, pandas) in the field of data science.  Instead, the book shows you how to build a lot of formulas ""from scratch"" and apply them conceptually.  As someone not very classically trained in statistics, I had a hard time grasping the notation used and was hoping the book would provide more ""real world"" applications to explain the theory.  Instead it starts often with the theory and applies it to hypothetical examples - a format which may be better served to someone with a good statistics background.For me personally, I found 
Data Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking
 to give a better introduction to a lot of the theories used in data science (albeit without any mention of Python) and found

"Joel does an excellent job tying a ""real-world"" scenario into the flow of this book to teach python for Data Science. I have experience with python but even those with little to no python experience can learn from this book. The only reasons for 4/5 stars are first, I would like to see the code for all charts used in the book like in section on ""Statistics"". Second, the setup used in book assumes you have placed sample code in your working directory. Some code calls classes from other code and expects it to be in the working directory. I would just call these out clearly. Other than these minor thoughts, I think this is an excellently written book and I highly recommend for anyone interested in data science, data analysis, or just wanting the skills to visualize clean and meaningful data. Well done!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"Nice book. Like the title says, all the techniques presented are ""from scratch."" I find it is not so practical when in the real world, there are many packages to do the same tasks. I started learning my coding from this book and found it is very difficult until I have gained much more experience with other packages. The book should focus more on the basic idea of data algorithm and make use of packages. In this book, the basic ideas were not presented so well which makes it hard to follow the code which write in great details. As a data scientist myself, I would prefer learning the basics from the book and find the most efficient tools for usage. This book does its job the other way around. The word ""from scratch"" is a bit misleading because if you think you have no idea what data science is and try to learn it from this book ""from scratch"" then you will probably get lost. It is for intermediated level data scientist who knows what they are doing and want to learn how the algorithm works. At least, that's what I feel.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"The book definitely provides the ability to do data analysis from scratch. However, I took that to mean it would provide me with the basic knowledge to do data science as its done in production. What you want find hardly anywhere in this book is a single discussion of how to use pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, or any of the other tools used by today's data scientists.It does provide you with the basics of how the analysis is done and the math behind a bunch of machine learning models. Unfortunately there's definitely a high expectation of math knowledge in this book, starting with at least Linear Algebra through Calculus.So, while I think this book had value, it was very different from what I was expecting. I think the target audience for this book is more an academic looking to apply their knowledge to a data science realm, and not so much a programmer wanting to learn how to actually implement machine learning or data analysis in code.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"I purchased and read this book because I was interested in learning about what data scientists ""do"" on a day-to-day basis, and the book definitely delivers in that respect.  It is very up-front in stating that it does not cover many of the details (e.g., requisite math/statistics background, coding in R, etc.), but it provides numerous references for learning this material for those who wish to take a deeper dive.  It provides perspectives from a number of experts in the field, along with their associated domains of expertise, and hence appears to give a good sampling of the different backgrounds and personalities of self-labelled data scientists.From a pedagogical perspective, I think it's a valiant attempt to create a class that's not so ""academic.""  The book is a compendium of individual lectures that were the basis of a data science class at Columbia University, and the corresponding assignments were aimed at giving students a flavor of real-world data science problems (where data is messy, specific questions regarding outcomes are not-well-formed, etc.), which I think is an amazingly valuable experience to give students perspective on what the field is about.  But I wonder if the course went a little *too* far into ""the real world is not pretty"" aspect of things.  The students wrote a chapter at the end of the book where they criticize a standard academic problem that comes from a statistical learning textbook and that, in my opinion, is a negative outcome.  While elegant mathematical theories do not describe the complexities of the real world, understanding the subtleties of algorithms is an important part of any scientific field, and to discount that is a disservice to the students.  Too much depth and not enough breadth is bad in the real world, but so is not having *enough* depth.  On the whole, though, I really applaud the approach of the authors at building a ""real-world"" class.One of the things that book has left me pondering is whether there is a clear distinction between data *science* and data *engineering*, and whether it is possible to have clear roles for people who are predominately scientists than those who are predominately engineers.  A few of the guest lecturers claim that 90% of the work of a data scientist is organizing the data, but I can't help but wonder if that's the bias of the individual speakers---that they *like* this component of the work and, therefore, focus on that more, rather than it being an absolute must to spend 90% of your time working on data structuring.  I am sure that if the authors were to read this comment, they would think that I am missing one of their major points (namely, that one can make a lot of mistakes in data leakage and that like from poor data structures, hence making this an integral part of the process).  But I think there's a certain personality type that really loves working on the actually processing component who would otherwise be turned off my too much data structuring if it really composed 90% of the work.  And harnessing the skills from those types of people is undoubtedly invaluable.  So I'm really wondering if many companies are able to break up roles where some people (the scientists) focus more on the processing part, while others (the engineers) focus more on the structuring part.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline
"This is a beautiful, thoughtful survey with excellent references.  I am an academic data scientist with nearly 20 years experience and I wanted a book to offer my students who are starting in the field.  This is it.The ""difficulty"" with data science is in the breadth of skills that are needed. Because data scientists need training in art, communication, statistics, and programming nobody is prepared to handle all the tasks and the neophyte (and expert) will need to fill in around their weaknesses.  This book does a brilliant job of working around that issue.  The writing is superb for a beginning to intermediate reader and the graphics and aside boxes are engaging.  More importantly. the references are plentiful and spot on.  In the areas I know well the authors suggest the things I recommend and where I am weak the recommendations have proven interesting.While this is a broad survey, there is some depth here.  There are formulas throughout but the book does not get bogged down in proofs and derivations.  There are programs written in R code scattered throughout.  The code is nicely commented but there is not a deep dive into how it words.  So, the reader who knows some R will learn a few new tricks but it does not interrupt the flow of the book.A reader who types the R code will run into problems.  Clearly the authors/editors did not attempt to run the code after the type setter mangled it.  For example, on page 39 there is a line which begins with a + and that character needed to be on the previous line.  In other places, (like page 49) functions are invoked (count) but the authors have not included the commands to make the functions available (in this case library(plyr)).  Sadly there does not seem to be an errata for the book and these will be major headaches or show stoppers for novices.While this book could be improved with a code supplement on the web (including the code to make all the graphics, complete solutions to the example/problems and an errata), this is a wonderful buy for readers of all levels.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline
"I make my living working with businesses to help them build their analytic capabilities in sales and marketing, by working on real opportunities and generalizing lessons from specific experiences and results.  Business sort of demands that over time you narrow problem-defining frameworks, problem-solving techniques, and problem-processing operations to what you can scale and consistently deliver.  But what I have learned is that if you push these past use as points of departure, and force them as points of arrival, results and learning suffer.  (As they say, if you have a hammer, then everything looks like, etc. etc.) This is especially true as things get more complex on all these fronts.  What I appreciated about this book was that even as it is an excellent survey of specific approaches and techniques at the coal-face of their application (there are code samples here, people!), it's also a thoughtful exposition of the limits of these and of the pitfalls they present.  You might be tempted to skip Chapters 15 and 16 if you're just looking to RTFM, but you shouldn't; for me they were the real meat of the book. Maybe it's confirmation bias at work, but it was reassuring to hear such a humble tone coming at the end of such a competent treatment of different data science challenges.  Doing this work very occasionally brings triumph and much more often despair, so it helps to have reminders from seasoned pros that what really matters is just trying, steadily, to get better at your craft.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline
"Not for the general reader.This is a somewhat difficult book about an emerging discipline of Data Science by a pre-eminent practitioner. But it is a necessary book to explain what this discipline encompasses. It is still too early to be absorbed into popular culture.This is really a text book which requires the reader to do the exercises so that the reader can grasp the topics. This is what makes the book difficult for the general reader. One has to be sufficiently competent enough with computers, programming, and statistics in order to appreciate the evolution of Data Science.Despite its difficulty, this book is a necessary introduction for the general public to understand the threat to democratic society from the misuse of Data Science. O'Neil explains this further in her call-to-arms (

"It seems there are some misses in the book \emph{Doing Data Science} by Cathy O'Neil and Rachel  Schutt page 61-62 when linear regression was discussed.  First of all, in page 61, in equation $y=x \cdot \beta$, it's perhaps better to indicate  that vector $x$ is different than the $x$ mentioned before. More specifically, $x = [x, 1]$.  More importantly, the target function in page 62:  \begin{equation}  RSS(\beta) = (y - \beta x)^{t}(y - \beta x)  \end{equation}  should be:  \begin{equation}  RSS(\beta) = (y - x \beta)^{t}(y - x \beta)  \end{equation}  Then we have:  \begin{eqnarray*}  \frac{\partial R}{ \partial \beta} &=& \frac{\partial (y - x \beta)^{t}(y - x \beta)}{\partial \beta}\\  &=& 2(y - x \beta)^{t}\frac{\partial(y - x \beta)}{\partial \beta} \\  &=& -2(y - x \beta)^{t}x = 0\\  &\Rightarrow& y^{t}x - \beta^{t}x^{t}x = 0 \\  &\Rightarrow& y^{t}x = \beta^{t}x^{t}x \\  &\Rightarrow& x^{t}y = x^{t}x \beta \\  &\Rightarrow& \beta = (x^{t}x)^{-1}x^{t}y  \end{eqnarray*}",4.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline

"I highly recommend this book to anyone with a genuine interest in data science *as a career*. What I mean by that is this book is not written as a textbook, but rather, as suggested by the title, as a guide to the actual reality of the occupation. Different chapters are based on lectures given by different practitioners in the field, and so the book as a whole gives an excellent holistic perspective on the profession. It took some getting used to, as I did expect more of an academic, textbook treatment---and to be fair, there is quite a bit of statistics and data wrangling in the book. But given that data science is not really a subject, but a job title (one can see this in the history of the term), the book's approach makes total sense. As a handbook for the profession, I found the book to be clear, substantive, and astonishingly thoughtful, particularly in regards to the ethical dimensions of the job. I wish more books would take such an expansive view of their subject.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline
"I work closely with some great data engineers and statistical programmers and am interested in practical applications of these skills. Generally, textbooks on statistics and machine learning are purely academic, but here the techniques are treated in the context of solving problems with data. The reality of working with real-world data is that it is rarely ready for analysis in its original state – it's a challenge to clean and organize. Applying the right analysis and gleaning insight is only possible with that groundwork.The style of the book is informal and friendly and different than most technical books. This makes it accessible to beginners or more experienced professionals who want a new angle on a topic with which they're familiar – it may be a turn-off to those who are looking for a more traditional approach. The book is not traditional – it has a style of its own and asks fundamental questions about the role data plays in our society.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline

"I bought this book as I was preparing for job interviews for data scientist positions. The book is a great overview of the general field of analyzing large datasets and building models. It strikes just the right balance between mathematical rigor and approachability. Specifically, every concept that is introduced is always accompanied by a real example involving real data, so its great to see what a particular method does to a set of numbers which, in my mind, is the clearest way to understand what an algorithm is actually doing. This book also served for me as a quick primer to R, as long as you are familiar with some other package for data handling & modeling (e.g. spss or matlab) the book got me comfortable with R very quickly.

"This book is great. I highly recommend it for anyone dealing with large-scale collaborative data projects.The author covers everything from saving and filing your data (good life skills even for those who don't use STATA) to documenting and cleaning datasets.The book reads fast and is interesting enough. Lots of general advice and then a few specific, detailed examples with full-fledged code that are easy to skip if they are not relevant (mercifully, he does not force you through the examples like some books do - they are fairly self-contained modules within the chapters). For each task, he tends to talk about the commands used (with relevant/most-helpful options), but then also about general rules for how to approach the task.The author's personal narrative dominates the book, but it is clear that he has a lot of experience and for the most part, it is helpful that the book is written that way. Some of the advice is shocking in its simplicity but its usefulness (i.e. ""Never name a file 'Final'"" lest you wind up with ""Final - v1"" ""Final - v2"" and ""Final - really really final"") - these are problems that are applicable to everyone. As such, although I have a reasonable amount of experience with STATA I felt that this book covered really useful basics in a way that was helpful but not tedious.Unsurprisingly for someone who writes about organization and workflow management, the book is also well-organized, and designed in such a way that you can read as you go, covering relevant chapters as you face the tasks within. I've been moving along at the pace of my project, highlighting commands as I read so that I can use it as a reference manual once I finish going through the first time.

"Disclaimer: I served as a paid technical editor for Data Smart. I am not affiliated with the publisher, but I did receive a small fee for double-checking the book's mathematical content before it went to press. I also went to elementary school with the author. So as you read the rest of the review, keep in mind that this reviewer's judgment could be clouded by my lifelong allegiance to Lookout Mountain Elementary School, as well as the Scarface-esque pile of one dollar bills currently sitting on my kitchen table.Anyway, books about ""Data"" seem to fit into one of the following categories:* Extremely technical gradate-level mathematics books with lots of Greek letters and summation signs* Pie-in-the-sky business bestsellers about how ""Data"" is going to revolutionize the world as we know it. (I call these ""Moneyball"" books)* Technical books about the hottest new ""Big Data"" technology such as R and HadoopData Smart is none of these. Unlike ""Moneyball"" books, Data Smart contains enough practical information to actually start performing analyses. Unlike most textbooks, it doesn't get bogged down in mathematical notation. And unlike books about R or the distributed data blah-blah du jour, all the examples use good old Microsoft Excel. It's geared toward competent analysts who are comfortable with Excel and aren't afraid of thinking about problems in a mathematical way. It's goal isn't to ""revolutionize"" your business with million-dollar software, but rather to make incremental improvements to processes with accessible analytic techniques.I don't work at a big company, so I can't attest to the number of dollars your company will save by applying the book's methods. But I can attest that the author makes difficult mathematical concepts accessible with his quirky sense of humor and gift for metaphor. For example, I previously had not been exposed to the nitty-gritty of clustering techniques. After a couple of hours with the clustering chapters, which include illuminating diagrams and spreadsheet formulas, I felt like I had a good handle on the concepts, and would feel comfortable implementing the ideas in Excel -- or any other language, for that matter.What I like most about the book is that it doesn't try to wave a magic data wand to cure all of your company's ills. Instead it focuses on a few areas where data and analytic techniques can deliver a concrete benefit, and gives you just enough to get started. In particular:* Optimization techniques (Ch. 4) can systematically reduce the cost of manufacturing inputs* Clustering techniques (Ch. 2 and 5) can deliver insights into customer behavior* Predictive techniques (Ch. 3, 6, and 7) can increase margins with better predictions of uncertain outcomes* Forecasting techniques (Ch. 8) can reduce waste with better demand planningIt may take some creativity to figure out how to apply the methods to your own business processes, but all of the techniques are ""tried and true"" in the sense of being widely deployed at large companies with big analytics budgets and teams of Ph.D.'s on staff. This book's contribution is to make these techniques available to anyone with a little background in applied mathematics and a copy of Excel. For that reason, despite the absence of glitter and/or Jack Welch on the book's cover, I think Data Smart is an important business book.I had a few criticisms of the book as I was reading drafts, but almost all of them were addressed before the final revision. For the sake of completeness, I'll tell you what they were. Some of the chapters ran on a bit long, but these have been split up into manageable pieces. The Optimization chapter is a bit of a doozie, and used to be at the very beginning, but the reader can now ""warm up"" with some easier chapters on clustering and simple Bayesian techniques. The Regression chapter originally didn't discuss Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, which are important for evaluating predictive models visually, but now ROC curves are abundant.Only one real criticism from me remains: I would have liked to see more on quantile regression, which is only mentioned in passing. It's a great technique for dealing with outlier-heavy data. The book by Koenker has good but highly mathematical coverage, and I would have loved to see this subject given the Foreman treatment. But, you can't have everything, and I suppose John needs to leave some material for Data Smart 2: The Spreadsheet of Doom.In sum, Data Smart is a well-written and engaging guide to getting new insights from data using familiar tools. The techniques aren't really cutting-edge -- in fact, most have been around for decades -- but to my knowledge this is the first time they've been presented in a way that Excel-slinging business analysts can apply the methods without needing her own team of operations researchers and data scientists. If you're not sure whether the book's sophistication is on par with your own skills, you can download a complete sample chapter (as well as example spreadsheets) from the author's website.One last thing: unlike many books with a technical bent, the prose is engaging and extremely clear. I think this can be traced to John's childhood. When John misbehaved, his father (who is a professor of English) would punish John by forcing him to read a novel by Charles Dickens. Minor infractions resulted in A Christmas Carol being meted out, and when he was really bad he had to read Great Expectations. This is a true story which you should ask John about if you see him at a book-signing event.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight
"I highly recommend John Foreman's book: 'Data Smart - Using Data Science to Transform Data into Insight'. The author's approach is unique - he teaches data science skills without teaching programming. His approach works because he limits the newness of each subject item to one dimension, that being the data science technique at hand. Each skill is introduced in the familiar environment of Excel and its spreadsheets. If the author had introduced a programming language at the same time, the difficulty of staying focused on the technique being taught would have been increased greatly.Each technique introduced is explained by first posing and then working through a business problem. Each problem has an accompanying Excel dataset. For each challenge, you are soon immersed in data - your Excel skills will be stretched and improved and you will need to work hard to keep abreast of each lesson. It is worthwhile for the reader because tangible learning occurs as the data is worked through and the business challenges are demonstrably solved.The techniques you will learn include:Cluster analysis using k-means and k-medians algorithmsDocument classification using a Naive Bayes algorithmOptimization modeling using linear programming methodsCommunity detection in network graphs using modularity maximizationLinear and logistic regressionEnsemble models based on bagging and boosting techniquesForecasting based on exponential smoothing with trend and seasonality (ETS)Outlier detection using k-nearest-neighbors and local outlier factorsIn addition to teaching techniques, the author sprinkles the text with conclusions he has formed based on his years of data science practice and on a healthy skepticism for some of the overblown claims made for data science. His advice includes the following:Beware the poorly posed problem. Data scientists must learn to communicate with stakeholders in order to help frame business problems properly.You will generally get more benefit by spending time selecting good data and engineering better data features than searching for a marginally better predictive model. A great model cannot deliver good performance with poor data.Remember, industry is not academia. In industry, analytics is a results-driven pursuit. The best model is the one that strikes a balance between performance and usability. If a model is never used, it is worthless.Mailchimp, the author's employer, has TB of data under management. However, it neither needs nor uses all this data for analysis and model training. Instead it aggregates its data to the level the business requires. This aggregate dataset is typically 10GB in size. This aggregation enables mailchimp to use R in production.Data science is not the most important function in the organization. The purpose of the data science function is to serve the business and help it achieve its goals. The purpose of data science is not to build models for their own sake.The author introduces the R programming language in the final chapter, as a gateway to doing further work in data science. R is very powerful but it can appear to be a black-box tool for solving data analysis problems. As the author explains, R has great performance but it is not great for explaining the inner workings of models.At the outset, the author explained that he preferred clarity over mathematical correctness when writing the book. He did an excellent job. The aspiring data scientist will learn by doing in the familiar and manageable environment of Excel.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight
"I would go as far as to say that the book is brilliant.First, a drop about me from the standpoint of this book. I have been an IT professional for many years specializing in programming, database, and MS Office add-ons. Part of my job entails self enrichment, that is, expand my working knowledge in areas potentially important for my job. I chose Foreman's book to help with this task for a number of reasons: a) Data Science is a hot area and my company does have a Data Science group, b) I have lots of data experience under my belt - I felt that it would be nice for once to get some useful information from the data, and c) I have a really good Excel background - so I figured that Foreman's approach would be perfect for me - little did I know that I would seriously add to my Excel bag of tricks.The author makes the assumptions that: a) the reader is somewhat technical, b) he knows nothing about Data Science, and c) he is relatively comfortable working in Excel.Reading the book is a joy because Foreman has a cozy, chummy style. He definitely doesn't throw all the technical stuff at the reader rat-tat-tat machine gun style like many other authors. Instead, Foreman gently introduces his topics and then ramps up technical details carefully. This most definitely helps the learning process.Speaking of learning, by the end of the you will have learned important concepts in ""machine learning"" and I believe that you will be ready for the next step. I sure was. I found the topics interesting and I wanted to learn more. This is where the book's only problem area comes into play - the next step. Foreman has 3 references - one good, but minor, one terrible, and the other is inappropriate. Let me explain.Foreman recommends a free resource as a follow-on to his Forecasting Chapter. This is a good reference, but I believe that Forecasting is a minor topic in Data Science, unless, of course, Forecasting becomes your thing.Foreman's main reference is: ""Data Mining with R"" by Luis Torgo. Foreman recommends this as the next step after his book.I tried to read this several times, but couldn't. It certainly wasn't my next step.The other reference, ""The Elements of Statistical Learning"" by Trevor Hastie, et. al, is totally inappropriate for Data Science newbies. You can checkout the Amazon reviews for this book and you'll see that you need a pretty serious background in statistics to get anything out of that reference. In fact, the author Hastie says as much in his next book ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning- with Applications in R"". This is the appropriate next step, but I'll get to that in a moment.Here are my recommendations:A. Read Foreman's book and follow along with him in working through the Excel spreadsheets. This is a first step in getting comfortable with Machine Learning.B. Take the Coursera courses: 1) Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach, and 2) Machine Learning: Regression. The courses are free unless you want completion certificates, in which case there is nominal cost.C. Now you are ready for:

"This is an excellent book and incredibly powerful if you're in any sort of field that requires data analysis. I've read many books on the subject of statistical analysis and most seem to fall in the category of:1.) A very technical ""how-to"" on using Excel/R/whatever to run certain functions but there is a huge assumption that you understand what the data output means. These are more like user manuals for their respective programs.2.) A more high-level view of stats that is similar to stuff you learned in Statistics 101 but with far less examples and it can be difficult to see how this will apply in your position.Foreman's book was recommended to me by Chandoo of Excel Guru fame and it is the book I've been searching for to step up my game. He does a great job of breaking down core concepts and introducing new tools(all in Excel!) that I can actually apply to my current position. That being said, there are a couple of caveats...1.) I would recommend at least 6 months of solid Excel usage under your belt. The author goes over the formulas and you can download the files online, however there is plenty of OFFSET and Array formulas that can be intimidating to more casual users. I highly recommend downloading the files and doing everything from scratch, and then using the author's version as reference when you get stuck.2.) This is not really a book you can breeze through(and I mean this as a compliment). The core concepts are broken down well but you will need to reread chapters to truly understand how the formulas and underlying concepts fit. I personally read Chapter 2 around 5-6 times so I can grasp k-means clustering and how I can apply it to my current project. I've only been in the data analysis world for a couple of years, so perhaps this is just my noviceness showing.This is a fantastic book and one I cannot recommend enough. I hope that Foreman continues to expand on this series as I really enjoy his writing style and his ability to confer what's truly important in data science.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight

"If you want to get started with Data Science and don’t like learning a new language such as R or Python, then this book is a perfect fit for you. Entertaining, Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight approaches data science from a unusual angle. John W. Foreman has written a book for those who wants to apply data mining without using advanced programming (R, Python, etc.). It doesn’t mean you don’t need to understand what data science is, and this book is very good at explaining it to non-practitioners.Foreman’s book is written in a nice and funny stile, which makes it an easy read. Data mining algorithms are described with the minimum equations needed. Foreman has written a practical book and thus decided to use Excel as a tool for data science. The book starts with an introduction to Excel and its most famous functions. For data scientists using SAS, R, Python or Matlab, you may discover how powerful Excel is. But you will also see how clumsy it is to use Excel for data science. Whereas you would need a few lines in R, the book will take you through a dozen pages of step by step actions you need to perform to obtain the same in Excel. Not only is it more time consuming but also more prone to errors.Don’t get me wrong: Data Smart is excellent at explaining how to perform data science in Excel. I just think Excel is not the right tool for it. The book is also a journey into MailChimp, the author’s company. This is nice and provides plenty of examples related to e-mail marketing. The book thus provides quick and high-level description of the problem, followed by Excel steps to solve it. In conclusion, Data Smart is a must read to get a fresh perspective on data science with a “Data Science using Excel” user manual. And for the experts? You can just skip the Excel parts and get insights into the field, with a focus on MailChimp use cases.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight

"The best single book on Data Science today. I handle the data analysis and BI for the delivery side of a huge internet-based retail company, and have been a fan of Foreman's since his ""Analytics Made Skeezy"" blog days.  His explanations are clear, his examples are to the point, and throughout it all, he is results-oriented. That is an important distinction; if you want theory, if you want to follow the development of algorithms, then attend a lecture by Moses Charikar (actually everyone should attend a Charikar lecture, just for the utter joy of the intellectual insights.) If you want a hands-on, practical guide to the processes involved in Data Science, then Foreman is your guy. Unlike many writers in the field, he is not an ""every problem is a nail"" guru, touting one magic approach to all problems. Neither is he a database guy or business stats guy who recently found it sexier and more lucrative to describe himself as a data scientist. Foreman is the real deal and short of hiring him as a consultant (if he still takes those kinds of jobs now that he's the brains behind the analytics at Mail Chimp) the next best thing you can do is read this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight

"Tukey looms large over the field of data visualization and computer science generally. He famously coined the term “bit” and invented the box plot. From page one of “EDA” you get a sense of what an incredible person he must have been: there is vivid metaphor and an almost folksy lightness throughout that reminds me of the most generous and patient teachers.Tukey most informed my own book’s tour through data exploration. I like how he exposed me to so many novel techniques (tally boxes, stem-and-leaf diagram, hinge diagram, and many more). Yes, they were were interesting to learn about, but they also showed me how creative you could get while exploring data. As he says in EDA, “don’t expect standard summaries to reveal the unusual.”I most appreciated Tukey’s tour of data transformations, and dedicated one of my own page spreads to re-introducing the “Ladder of Transformation” to a new generation. I consider EDA to be essential reading. Its length may be intimidating, but do not worry. Lots of the content is textbook exercises and examples, printed with multiple-page data tables for reference, all of which can be skipped as you plow through.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exploratory Data Analysis

"In the preface, Tukey writes, ""this book ... exists to expose its readers and users to a considerable variety of techniques for looking more effectively at one's data.""  It succeeds remarkably well and is still relevant: after over 40 years, many of the techniques still have not been incorporated in commercial software and some of those that have (such as box-and-whisker plots and robust smoothing) are often emasculated.This book has served me well for decades: I have used most of its techniques in my statistical consulting practice and, more recently, have used it as a foundation for courses in data analysis that range from a few hours to an entire semester.  Students always appreciate the practical experience and set of tools they acquire.  The more experienced ones comment on the insight: ""I never fully understood what the box-and-whisker plot really did until now"" is a recent example from a mid-career engineering professional.Nevertheless, it is true that some of the material is outmoded due to its focus on manual calculation and some of the rest may be too idiosyncratic for most.  What remains--which is plenty--can be studied on its own, because this book is designed for self-study: most of the chapter groups are independent of all but the introductory material, they provide detailed examples, ask many thought-provoking questions, and supply many datasets for practice.  Tukey's methods speak for themselves through the gains in insight they provide, so he is content to show *how* to do them and to provide copious examples.  What he does not do is supply the mathematical theory.  If you like, you can read about that in Hoaglin, Mosteller, and Tukey's ""Understanding Robust and Exploratory Data Analysis"".The highlights of this book, in terms of techniques, are:*  Chapters 1-4 on graphing data and on basic, useful data summaries: stem-and-leaf plots and n-letter summaries.  Most statistical software now provides these.  They are of primary interest as building blocks in more advanced analyses.*  ""Straightening out plots:"" simple, effective techniques to re-express the independent and dependent variables in a bivariate scatterplot so that the relationship becomes approximately linear.  (Chapters 5 and 6.)  I am not aware of any software that does this, but the techniques are so simple and elegant you can still carry them out with pencil and paper (or a spreadsheet) even with huge datasets.*  Smoothing sequences (chapters 7, 8, and 16).  The ""3rssh"" method has largely been displaced by Lowess smooths in software, but the principles and ideas of smoothing, ""roughing,"" and ""re-roughing"" are timeless.*  Analyses of two-way tables using median polish.  This technique has recently been exploited in various fields, including spatial statistics, but only in the most elementary way.  Think of this as a robust version of Analysis of Variance, with a focus on finding the effects, but without any of the mathematical apparatus.  (Chapters 10 and 11.)  One of the best tools for performing median polish is a spreadsheet.*  Advanced fitting of two-way tables: adding an interaction term; transforming the dependent variable; plotting the fits.  (Chapters 12 and 13.)*  Techniques for re-expressing and analyzing counts and fractions.  (Chapters 15, 17, and 18.)Additional material covers ""delineations"" of scatterplots (chapters 8, 9, and 14) and assessing distributions (chapters 19 and 20).  The latter suffers in retrospect from not using probability plotting methods.  The former is worth learning but there does not seem to be any simple way to use modern statistical software to create these delineations.In brief, this book requires no more mathematical prerequisite than facility with arithmetic, but after working through it, the diligent reader will come away with a body of techniques for understanding almost any kind of data set, including methods of time series analysis, regression, analysis of variance, and contingency table analysis.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exploratory Data Analysis
"I reviewed this book when it first appeared in 1977 -- having been reading preliminary versions for about a decade before that.At the time I offered the not-very-prescient opinion that it would quickly become a classic. It has.The various reviews on this site are all correct. Yes there are still wonderful ideas to be mined (easy univariate transformations to symmetry, transforms to linearity to aid in curve fitting, the crucial importance of robustness, of looking at outliers and fringeliers, and the dominant role that graphics plays in forcing us to see what we never expected).And yes, there is some material that is out-dated (e.g. using break points to estimate logs in your head).But these are beside the point -- Scholars still study Talmud and Newton's Principia. Why? Obviously there are many reasons varying with the work and the reader.For me a principal reason for reading (and rereading) EDA is to get a close look at how a first class mind works, with the hope that when faced with a similar problem we can then try to emulate him. To this day as I read EDA I can see Tukey's smiling face patiently explaining to me how to look at data and exhorting me not to miss subtle hints.This was a book to be treasured when it first became available, and I see no reason for that judgment to change now, or in the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exploratory Data Analysis

"My reading of ""Data Cartels"" written by Sarah Lamdan has been, I'm sorry to say, a painful six months in the making, even for an avid reader like me who reads the books laden on the coffee table in my doctor's office. This thought-provoking book dives deep into the world of data monopolies and the dangers they pose to our society. The author manages to recreate a modern-day witch hunt targeting large conglomerates (RELX, Thomson Reuters, and Bloomberg) that she condemns for collecting troves of information with some nefarious purpose.Lamdan argues that the concentration of data power into a few hands leads to the creation of data cartels. These cartels are monopolizing access to data and controlling the infrastructure through which the data is transmitted and processed.The author takes a critical look at the impact of these data cartels on our society, including the potential for increased inequality, the erosion of privacy, and the stifling of innovation. Lamdan argues that these cartels have the power to shape the future of society and that we must take action to prevent their dominance.The book provides an analysis of the data economy based on the back of a few in the industry. Lamdan examines the role of some tech companies, governments, and the general public in this ecosystem. She presents a clear and concise overview of the current state of the data economy and the challenges we face in ensuring fair and equitable access to data.One of the things I was disappointed about in this book is that Lamdan focused most of her work on criticizing large corporations and should have offered a sustainable solution to the problem at hand instead of a few ideas. Lamdan needs to realize that the aggregation of data, algorithms and SQL statements aren't amassed or created to be discriminatory.In my line of work, where would the retail industry be without the data collected by Computer-Generated Ordering (CGO) and Point of Sales Systems (POS)? Or, my favourite, the data that continues to fuel the performance of eCommerce platforms in serving retail customers? Collecting and interpreting data is in the interest of retailers and consumers alike. Extracting answers to questions about customer preferences can be tricky, but it should not be viewed with suspicion. Rather, retailers looking to model customer profiles using various data sources are working with a singular purpose: to provide an exchange of personalized value that ultimately benefits consumers.In summary, ""Data Cartel"" is a drooping eye book that tries to address the growing concentration of data power in the hands of a few, wrapped in a modern-day bore. I don't recommend this book to anyone interested in the future of technology and society.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Data Cartels: The Companies That Control and Monopolize Our Information

"The book had a lot of valuable information, and I definitely would recommend it to security operations professionals. It, however, fails to meet the expectations set by the title. The author wrote the book to be available to a general audience which may or may not have security operations experience and thereby did not leave room to delve into the details of how data analytics marry with security. Insofar as the book did cover these topics, they were very scattered except in the first section. The author was not able to gather the topics into a coherent, clear explanation beyond the first section.

"THIS IS THE GREATEST BOOK EVER PUBLISHED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS!!!If I could give this book 10 stars, I would! This book beats many other books. This book is so exciting to read that I read it three times! The beginning of the book said it extremely well -- This book is about an unique kind of leadership that has the natural recurring pattern of inspiring, influencing and affecting people. It is about a very small group of leaders that achieve disproportionate amount of influences in their industries/areas compare to other leaders. The most prominent example is, of course, Steve Jobs who displayed a recurring pattern of changing one industry after another.(Of all the books that study Steve Jobs, this is probably the best one although it is not a book on Jobs' biography. However, this book offers the best angle to understand his motivation and influence.)The core of this book is about the kind of WHYs that a special kind of leaders has that enable them to have the natural recurring pattern of inspiring, influencing and changing people and industries. The prime examples of this kind of leaders quoted in this book are Steve Jobs, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Wright Brothers.This book is revolutionary. All the top business schools should reevaluate their curriculum based on this book! All the top business consultants should reconsider their theories and recommendations based on this book! All the writers on leadership should read this book and revise their theories! All political leaders in the world should read this book! All board of directors of corporations should read this book and learn how to select the next CEOs! ...This book can be considered the MASTER book to be read before reading books like ""From Good to Great"", ""Stall Points"", ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" and the follow-on books, ""Crossing the Chasm"" ...The central theme of this book is WHY -- the essence, the core, the purpose of a person's life, of leadership, and the starting point of a corporation. Without the clarity of this WHY, the life of a person, the leadership, and the products and services offered by a corporation are all fuzzy and treated as commodities. This is so very true. Look around us: Though we (persons, organizations and corporations) are special in some ways, yet we are almost all commodities -- except the very few that display the recurring pattern of major changes and influences such as Jobs, Apple and Google. These are the ones that have the clarity of WHY and the discipline of diligently and strictly enforcing their HOWs (principles, methods, criteria) in producing the WHATs (behaviors, products and services).There are three views of WHY + HOW + WHAT presented in this book:1. Looking from the top -- the WHY in the center, the HOW in the middle and the WHAT in the outer layer form a GOLDEN CIRCLE.2. Looking from the side -- the WHY at the top layer, the HOW in the middle layer and the WHAT in the bottom layer form a cone.3. Viewing in three dimensions -- with the external world attached to the base of WHAT, the whole thing is a megaphone for the leader or corporation to sound out its WHY.These views are wonderful ways for us to look at leadership, to understand the life cycle of a corporation, and summarily see why companies thrived and why they died. These views can even be applied to our personal lives.Of course, this book has some blemishes. But these defects do not distract from its greatness.1. The grammar is terrible. The whole book should be reviewed by a competent editor.2. The WHYs are not strictly examined and evaluated. This book treats all WHYs from leaders, entrepreneurs and corporations as equal when in fact they are not. Probably most of the WHYs are the rewording of WHATs in disguise. Maybe a lot of WHYs are re-branded HOWs. Perhaps only a small number of WHYs can have the recurring pattern of inspiration and influence. I hope the future editions of this book can elucidate this point.3. The HOWs gets much less treatment than the WHYs and WHATs in the book. It would be great if this topic is covered in more detail.4. Maybe 60% of this book is about corporations and not on leadership as claimed in the beginning of the book. I hope the author can focus more on the recurring pattern of inspiration and influence of leadership.5. Not everything stated in this book is correct. The points discussed in this book about Jobs and Apple are good examples. Please read ""Inside Apple"" and Jobs biographies for more correct views on Jobs and Apple.At the first reading, the book seems repetitious. The WHY, HOW and WHAT get repeated over and over. However, on the 2nd and 3rd reading, this apparent repetition disappears and you can see the different points that the author was trying to emphasize.I would like to recommend some future topics or books for Simon Sinek:a) Qualify and rank levels of WHYs -- not all WHYs are equal. Probably some are top-notch while most are mediocre. Also, tell us how to construct best kinds of WHYs.b) Compare the WHYs to big tech companies, the WHYs of big Wall Street firms (if they have any???) and the WHYs of big retail companies.c) Compare the WHYs of big empires in historyd) Compare the WHYs of nations in WWI and WWIIe) Compare the WHYs of great leaders in historyf) Compare the WHYs of great geniusesg) Consider how WHYs can be incorporated into Teachers' College (Ed College). It is the teachers who educate our future generations. They need to be thoroughly immersed in the understanding of The Golden Circle, The Cone and The Megaphone.h) Consider how WHYs can be incorporated into the K-12 and the college educationg) Consider how WHYs can be incorporated into and how HOWs can be enforced in our political systems. We have far too many politicians and not enough true leadersi) Consider how WHYs can be incorporated into our law schools. Our lawyers really need a strong dose of treatment.In summary, this book is dynamic. It's a dynamite! It's the best book I have read in the last 10 years!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action
"While the subtitle of this book (How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action) suggests that the content is for leaders of large organizations, I believe the book's details can apply to all kinds of leaders and businesses.The main mantra of the book is:People don’t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.The book includes stories of many different companies. Some were successful, and others were not. The successful ones were led by individuals who strongly believed in something (they had a Why), which was the business's guiding principle. The unsuccessful companies may have started out doing well, but when they lost their focus on their Why, or if the person who had that vision left the organization, the business started to falter.I agree with the author’s point that having a strong Why for your business can help that business be successful. I highlighted all the successful companies and individuals in the book and want to study them further. Here’s an alphabetical list of who I intend to examine:- Apple & Steve Jobs- Bridgeport Financial- Ernest Shackleton- Harley Davidson- Henry Ford- Ron Bruder — Education for Employment Foundation- Southwest Airlines- Thomas Edison- The Wright BrothersOne key concept from the book that hit home with me was that when you have a strong Why you will naturally attract individuals to your business who share that Why. A strong Why will allow you to market based on these beliefs instead of using manipulative tactics like price, features, and benefits.That’s what a WHY does. When it is clearly understood, it attracts people who believe the same thing.Another central point Why is so important relates to hiring (or being hired). It’s essential to have everyone in an organization believe in the same Why to have the best performing team. This requires a leader who knows their Why and knows how to share the details of their Why with others.While reading the books, I made some other highlights that I think were important concepts:- “There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can manipulate it or you can inspire it.”- “WHAT companies do are external factors, but WHY they do it is something deeper.”- “Why the product exists must first be considered and why someone wants it must match.”- “If a customer feels inspired to buy a product, rather than manipulated, they will be able to verbalize the reasons why they think what they bought is better.”- “Knowing your WHY is not the only way to be successful, but it is the only way to maintain a lasting success and have a greater blend of innovation and flexibility.”- “No matter where we go, we trust those with whom we are able to perceive common values or beliefs.”This book has helped me personally. I’m in the process of trying to start a business, teaching others how to use productivity software (so far just Microsoft Excel, but I have plans to branch out to other applications). My training content is specifically geared towards those who may be intimidated by software and computers in general.I need to spend more time thinking about my Why, but my initial Why is that I believe anyone can learn to use productivity software; they need to get past any fear of using the software and computers. I think the biggest fear people have when learning new things is the fear of the unknown. I want to show people it’s not hard to learn to use software and computers if they take a little time to learn the basics. I want to help them convert the unknown to a known.If you’ve thought about starting or are running your own business, do you know your Why? Is your Why evident in everything you do related to that business? If not, I would urge you to take some time to read Start With Why and to get clear on your Why.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action

"I really had to struggle with what rating to give this.  Simon Sinek's idea is astoundingly insightful, very helpful, and definitely worth the price of this book let alone the Kindle price.  I'm inclined to think that the world would be considerably better off if more people lived by Sinek's simple idea.On the other hand, the book is agonizing in its redundancy, often repeating the same examples many times over to make precisely the same point as the first time the example was used.  I'm inclined to think that virtually everything Sinek wrote could have been stated in a 20-page article without leaving out anything important.  I daresay it might be possible to do it in five pages.  That's part of the beauty of the idea: it's incredibly simple while still being astoundingly powerful.  But Sinek doesn't seem to have bothered taking the time to distill the idea down into its essence for straightforward presentation in this book.  It reads a little bit like he took articles from his blog, stuck them in a large word-processing document, did some minor editing, and submitted the thing as-is for publication in order to create this book.So, the idea is worth the cost of the book and the time to read it, but the book itself is, in my humble opinion, very poorly organized and needlessly long.I would advise those who are interested in Sinek's ideas save themselves a great deal of time and a little expense by first watching his TED Talk:[...]This covers virtually all the core ideas involved.  The one thing Sinek never does either in this presentation or in his book is spell out what ""HOW"" is.  It's a bit confusing in large part because it's different for each of the two communication structures.  In the ""WHAT --> HOW"" structure, ""HOW"" is ""how we're different""; for instance, Dell has to argue that its computers are somehow better than (say) HP's and therefore specifies HOW they're better in order to compete against HP.  On the other hand, in the ""WHY --> HOW --> WHAT"" structure, ""HOW"" is ""how we enact our purpose (i.e. our 'WHY')"".As far as I can tell, if you're reasonably intelligent you can glean pretty much everything essential to Sinek's idea based on his TED Talk together with this understanding that ""HOW"" means something different in each of the two contexts he contrasts.What you WON'T get from that is his rather in-depth, incredibly clear exposé of why the ""WHAT --> HOW"" communication pattern requires manipulating people to some degree or another and why that is by necessity unsustainable in the long run.  That's not core to his point but it's certainly a nice supplement.So in short, the book is a reasonable buy, certainly at the Kindle price, but do consider benefitting from Sinek's wisdom for free in 20 minutes first by watching his TED Talk.  If you want more details, you can get the book, but understand that you're not likely to learn much more than what you could have figured out on your own between the talk and what I mention above.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action

"I really enjoyed reading this. I loved the examples that the author highlighted (like the Wright brothers, Southwest Airlines, Disney, and Costco) and thought they were a great fit. I also learned a lot from them (both from the history side and the book’s message side). My only criticism is that I didn’t always like the transitions between story examples. A lot of the time, the author would start talking about an example, finish part of the story, continue with something else, and then return to it later. And I get that; I understood why he was choosing to do so. I just don’t think all of the transitions worked, and when they didn’t, they would take me out of my enjoyment in reading the book. Is it a big deal? No, but enough of one to lower the rating to a 4 (more like a 4.5).",4.0 out of 5 stars,Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action
"I loved this book, very inspiring! It delves deep into various facets of ‘great leadership’ and offers a wealth of actionable insights. All centered around one core theme, “start with WHY”. In fact, I loved it so much that I ordered three copies of this book to gift to my close friends.Addressing some of the comments from the other reviewers, I mainly see two concerns:1. All the concepts are presented in the TED talk already, so we can skip reading this book.2. There is a lot of repetition in the book - repetition of the same examples/concepts over and over again.I have seen Mr. Sinek’s famous TED talk before as well as after reading this book and here is how I compare them. The TED talk is an excellent trailer for the material offered in this book. Mr. Sinek (in this book) presents the “WHY concept” as a framework and then shows how this framework can be applied to different phases/aspects of leadership. “Decision making”, “Trust”, “Authenticity”, are a few leadership aspects that he expands on. Since the same framework is applied to many different aspects and scenarios, we do find that some text and examples are repeated. However, if we patiently continue, we’d find that there is a new, different point being made in every chapter. Overall, regarding the above two concerns - I disagree with the first, while I do have to partially agree with the second.The book teaches a lot about leadership. Here is what you’d learn in each chapter. In other words, here is my ‘why list’ for this book:1. Why ‘decision making’ can’t always be data-driven?2. Why leaders who choose to inspire (as opposed to those who manipulate) command ‘loyalty’?3. WHY is the center of the ‘golden circle’. Introduction to the golden circle.4. Why does the human brain/thinking align with the golden circle? The biology of it.5. Why and how good leaders achieve ‘authenticity’?6. Why and how good leaders manage to earn the trust of their followers/team?  1. Why good leaders hire for culture-fit rather than for mere skill?7. Why do greater leaders have this charisma, due to their ability to communicate ‘their why’ clearly?  1. Why focusing on early adopters is important? Law of diffusion of innovations.8. Why and how good leaders build partnerships with (how-to) people who can execute the vision to reality?9. Why good leaders should do ‘what they do’ (your actions/results) to reflect their ‘WHY’ (vision)?10. Why leaders use their ‘WHY’ (vision) to filter their decision making?11. Why and how good leaders are successful (and feel successful) every day?12. Why good leaders/companies impart their ‘sense of why’ into their culture?13. WHY of an individual depends upon his past and upbringing. Mr. Sinek’s WHY.14. WHY can keep you going on a long journey in-spite of failures.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action
"A lot of people are searching for a clearer understanding of what ""HOW"" is (especially judging by the most highly rated review).I was searching for it also. I found it over the course of much labor, across many other books and a large number of hours of additional research. HOW is only how you deliver your product when you start with WHAT - when you start with WHY, your HOW also changes. HOW becomes how you bring your WHY to life in your CULTURE, not productsSo you start with WHY (your purpose). HOW do we deliver a purpose? HOW we deliver a WHY (purpose) is in HOW we behave - through Core Values. With purpose and aligned core values, the broad guidelines for every decision is in place. The validity of every system is obvious. The people to hire are clear. The reasons to fire are even more clear. And every person instantly knows the validity of every decision.Think about it. Just like the golden circle concept, this fits. You cannot go backwards from WHAT (product) to HOW (core values). You will NEVER have an aligned WHY if you write the core values first. The consistency is immediately obvious. The golden circle must be in balance.WHY is the purpose, and HOW are the Core Values around which we make every single decision, even in the absence of the visionary. It's HOW we make our WHY come to life every day. Our core values tell us who to hire, who to fire, and which decisions are right on a micro-level. Is that system or that process true to our core values?Try to create core values. You cannot create genuine, honest core values without first knowing WHY you exist. When you know your WHY (such as apples challenging the status quo), you can then describe the values (in terms of behaviors) that exemplify that WHY. Without a WHY, core values are blatantly phony and greed-serving things. Without a WHY, nobody cares what your core values are, because all we know is your WHAT. If all we know is your WHAT, then the rest just comes down to features and price. But if we know your WHY, we can buy into your HOW (core values), which we see reflected in your WHAT (product)Look at it in the light of Zappos:WHY - to deliver the best customer service possibleHOW - CORE VALUES:1.Deliver WOW Through Service2.Embrace and Drive Change3.Create Fun and A Little Weirdness4.Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded5.Pursue Growth and Learning6.Build Open and Honest Relationships With Communication7.Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit8.Do More With Less9.Be Passionate and Determined10.Be HumbleSure, they sell shoes online. But they dont seek to innovate how people shop online (WHAT-based HOW). Instead, they seek to bulid a culture around core values centered on their WHY. Nobody mentions anything about product until the WHAT.The constitution is another great example of a WHY & HOW which guides us in an ever evolving WHAT. It doesnt try to make every law, or build every system. The constitution is our WHY, followed by our HOW. The president knows WHAT because he is guided by the WHY and HOW. When one president is replaced after 4 to 8 years, there is no lapse, no lack of clarity as we find in corporations - Tell me why that is? Because we define our WHY (purpose) and HOW (core values) in our CONSTITUTION, as every good company should have. Without a supreme law of the land, nothing stops a CEO from destroying the company when the prior CEO steps down.UNITED STATES CONSTITUTIONWHY - We believe all humans have a right to life, liberty, and a pursuit of happiness.HOW - our Core Values are the values we hold most dear, through which we show what we believe, out of which our culture grows, out of which our laws are defined, redefined, and removed. It does NOT attempt to define every situation, or create every law, or prevent every problem. it is our WHY and HOW, out of which we are left to determine WHAT.We believe in fair representation of the peopleWe believe in freedom to defend ourselves.We believe in speaking out against injustice.We believe in expressing ourselves as we see fit.We believe that no individual should hold total power to undo these things.Hope this helps, or at least stimulates discussion.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action

"I harbour a love for learning, which is what drew me to this book. I wanted to make sense of ‘data’ — it was a buzz word that kept cropping up in conversations and news reports about all things appertaining to business…but frankly I didn’t have much of a grasp of it.Wanting to stay up to date and move with the times motivated me to purchase the book. Even though I had little pre-existing knowledge on the subject, I found Asplen-Taylor’s explanation of it fascinating.It’s good to have finally gleaned a greater understanding of something that is discussed so frequently and that I felt I really should understand but never did. 10/10 would recommend to a friend (and indeed already have)!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data and Analytics Strategy for Business: Unlock Data Assets and Increase Innovation with a Results-Driven Data Strategy

"Nelson is a private consultant who has worked on countless practical problems in reliability from his consulting practice and previous employment at General Electric. He is an excellent lecturer and writer. His earlier book ""Applied Life Data Analysis"" was considered to be one of the best texts on reliability.This book is very thorough in its treatment of all aspects of accelerated testing and is filled with many good references. Nelson carefully defines the mathematical models which consist of two components, (1) an acceleration function which describes how the mean lifetime changes as a function of the acceleration factor and (2) a probability distribution that explains the random variability of outcomes at each acceleration factor. A particular mean function could be the Arrhenius relationship and the probability distribution could be exponential. Hence there is not a single Arrhenius acceleration model but rather an Arrhenius-exponential, an Arrhenius-lognormal or an Arrhenius-Weibull model. The book is filled with interesting theory and examples. Nelson provides excellent practical guidance based on his wealth of experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Accelerated Testing: Statistical Models, Test Plans, and Data Analysis (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)"
"Dr. Taylor does his usual great job covering a difficult subject - ties in well with his ""Applied Life Data Analysis"", the revered reliability resource.

"After browsing, I saw that it attempted to teach stats without going into the maths in too much detail. Instead the author wanted the reader to gain intuition for regression first of all, and then go on to study in the traditional way armed with this knowledge.Seemed like a good idea, but after about 80 pages I gave up and went for the various Dummies books instead, plus a couple of others.Coming back to it now having learnt so much, it makes a lot more sense. But the first time around it was too challenging and demotivating to say the least. Also, there may be less maths, but it is heavy on using the old greek letters with about 10 subscripts/superscipts clinging on to them somewhere.This isn't a bad book overall and I like the idea of not focusing on the maths, but think this is best read AFTER having gone through those books.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Analysis of Economic Data

"Ich beschäftige mich in letzer Zeit mit einem Twitter-Bot namens Vanellus. Vanellus lädt alle Deutschsprachigen Tweets (ca. 1Million/Tag) herunter und man kann alle möglichen Analysen der Daten durchführen. Für derartige Analysen braucht man keine exakten Algorithmen. Ich wollte mich daher näher mit der Frage beschäftigen, wie man mit Probabilistic Algorithms den Berechnungen beschleunigen kann. Für diesen Zweck war das Buch ein schlechter Kauf. Die Autoren beschreiben ihr Konzept wie folgt:""We have taken the view that, in order to best apply and understand the strengths and weaknesses of heuristic methods, a firm grasp of underlying probability theory and rigorous techniques - as we present in this book - is necessary. We hope that students will appreciate this point of view by the end of the course"".Nachdem ich mathematische Stastitik studiert habe, muss ich den ersten Teil nicht mehr lernen. Wenn ich einen Algo für die Lösung eines Problems suche, sind mir die Beweise ziemlich egal. Ich will möglichst genau wissen wie er geht und für welche Probleme er geeignet ist. Ich will selbst nicht einen Algo publizieren, sondern ein Programm schreiben, dass ein Problem löst. Es kommen im Buch sehr viele mathematischen Symbole, jedoch kein (Pseudo-)Kode von Algorithmen vor.Es sind viele dieser Beweise praktisch irrelevant. Z.B. ist das Traveling-Salesman Problem theoretisch NP-hard. Es gibt jedoch Algorithmen, die erstaunlich effektiv sind. Die Pathologischen Fälle die das Problem explodieren lassen interessieren einem nicht bzw. man lässt in diesem Fall einen anderen heuristischen Algo laufen.Ein Beispiel für die Irrelevanz derartiger Überlegungen liefert das Buch selbst. Die Autoren lieben das von ihnen entwickelte ""Cuckoo Hashing"". Man löst Hash-Kollisionen auf, indem man den neuen Wert abspeichert und den alten Wert mit einer anderen Hash-Funktion an einer neuen Stelle speichert. Der neue Wert wirft quasi den alten aus dem Nest. Der alte Wert kann an der neuen Stelle wieder einen Wert aus dem Nest werfen. Das Spiel setzt sich solange fort, bis ein noch nicht besetztes Nest gefunden wird. Es lässt sich mathematisch zeigen, dass diese Methode weniger runs erzeugt, die Tabelle zufälliger anfüllt, als simple lineare Kollisonsauflösung (man sucht linear die erste freie Stelle). Praktisch gesehen ist jedoch die einfache, lineare Methode wesentlich besser. Die lineare Methode ist Cache-freundlich, die Kuckucks-Methode erzeugt systematisch Cache-misses. Aber so was kommt in der Welt der Mathematiker die nicht direkt programmieren nicht vor.Die Bewertung des Buches hängt von den Erwartungen ab. Im Sinne der theoretischen Informatik verdient es 5-Sterne, aus praktischer Sicht (wie oben beschrieben) ist es wenig brauchbar. Man könnte auch argumentieren, dass ich beim Kauf nicht genau geschaut habe und nun nicht zu lamentieren brauche.

"If you already have some background in python but are not a total expert in pandas, I strongly recommend this book. I walks you and motivates through the data structures that are used in pandas en explains their _raison d'être_. The style is easy read.Personally, I spent last semester going from a beginner to an intermediate/advanced level in python computing for data analysis. You sometimes wonder why there are out there so many data structures that seem to do the same thing (panda dataframe, numpy arrays, lists and dictionary) and when to use each. This is what I learned from this book. It systematically compares basic python with panda's and sometimes to numpy, and ultimately helps you to see how using them can improve your performance.I would not recommend it to someone with no background in python, let alone programming.

"I'm a Python software developer with an interest in applied statistics. This is an excellent book on data analysis, but for review purposes, it's worth initially pointing out what this book is not.It is not a comprehensive survey of open source tools that are available, and it does not contain many examples of working code to implement the techniques he talks about, though there are some. For this reason, I'd strike the ""with Open Source Tools"" from the title in evaluating whether you want to purchase the book.The author greatly favors mathematical notation over code examples in describing the data analysis techniques he presents. While this is not a bad thing per se, you'll have to struggle to comprehend the content if you're a programmer without an academic familiarity with math, or if you've been away from mathematics for a long time.As other reviewers have pointed out, the organization of the content is somewhat disjointed. Going from chapter to chapter, there is little in the way of causality, and the early chapters are pretty math-heavy. The reader is advised to consult appendices at the back of the book to refresh themselves on the basics, if required.Wait! I didn't say you shouldn't buy it.Despite a few shortcomings, this book does offer a good introduction and overview of several basic techniques. It's an excellent survey of the current data analysis landscape for anyone who's not familiar with it. If a topic seems irrelevant to you, it's pretty easy to skip that chapter and move forward.On top of that, the author's writing style and ways of explaining relatively esoteric concepts is generally very good. As with many good books, you get the sense the author is a co-worker, trying to explain something to you in terms you can understand. It's very example-based, even if those examples don't always involve code.All in all, to get the most out of this book, the best approach is careful and methodical study. The author covers many topics quickly, and not any one in depth, so if one chapter interests you, I'd plan on consulting other resources on particular topics. Luckily, the author does offer several ""Further Reading"" recommendations for each topic.Most books containing information on these techniques are far harder to read, and they generally cost at least twice as much. Highly recommended. Thanks for this one, Philipp.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"The book has lofty ambitions, and after a perusal of the table of contents, appears to live up to it. But after delving into the book, I was extremely disappointed. Here are the core problems:1) The most glaring omission: the author will often finish an entire section describing how to use an open source tool to analyze data, WITHOUT TELLING YOU WHAT TOOL HE IS USING. Take Chapter 6, for example (""Intermezzo: A Data Analysis Section""). He begins belting out lines of code like ""plot 'data' u 1 w 1"" without ever stating what language or what tool he's actually using. A simple ""I'm using gnuplot"" would suffice. But he literally finishes the entire chapter without ever telling the reader that he's using gnuplot. That information is not contained in headers, in the text, in the chapter, in code comments - nowhere. I ended up using Google to determine what language the syntax was for.2) All of the examples are unrealistic, contrived, or elementary. The author conjures up datasets that are ""amazingly"" well-adapted to whatever technique is being discussed, does not re-use data sets to illustrate different points, and overall leaves the reader feeling like they've been through a whirlwind of different data sets without any deep grasp of the principles involved.3) The author gives plenty of lip service to people who are ""scared"" of math, and says things like ""Don't be scared by big formulas!"", but a few pages later is belting out complex mathematical concepts with no explanation of what he's talking about. As a reader familiar with advanced statistics, I was left feeling like the book consisted of a LOT of filler material for the ""scared of math"" crowd, which really bored me. The author needs to pick one audience or the other, and write the book to that audience. Otherwise, he's trying to ride two horses going different directions.4) The programs and code in this book were shallow, and often had requirements for the data formatting that went unstated in the text or in the comments of the code. For example, the LOESS function the author gives (4 or 5 lines, at the end of Chapter 3) requires the data to be sorted and in order. Otherwise it's all senseless. But the author doesn't state this fact.The one good thing I got out of this book was the bibliography - it was useful to get a data scientist's list of books for each topic, and a sentence or two about each book's strengths and weaknesses.It's like all the editors of this book were asleep at the switch. I've had some of the same exact issues with other O'Reilly books (the ""riding two horses"" problem of simultaneously writing for very technical and very non-technical audiences, and the problem of unstated assumptions and requirements for functions and code). O'Reilly books used to be high caliber. Now, they're poor-quality books that rush through their topic and never give a thorough treatment.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"Data Analysis with Open Source Tools does a great job covering a lot of topics in way that balances theoretical explanations and practical demonstration. In keeping true to its title, a wealth of tools (and data sources) are identified and explored.Because the book offers a balance between explanation and demonstration it can be read in two different ways. First, you can read the chapters without getting involved with the code to get a better understanding of the whys and hows of the different analysis techniques. On the other hand, if you are more of a brass tacks person, you can focus on the code, run the examples, and just skim the explanations.For those that are exploring the world of data analysis, this book is a great compliment to Segaran's

 and Russell's

. Where the books overlap the explanations and examples differ which helps enormously when trying to master the concepts and techniques. However, each book contains topics not in the others. Collectively they offer a rather powerful set of tools.Having read the other books prior to this one, I really appreciated the time spent on the mathematics behind each technique. The others get your hands dirty very quickly - and I appreciated that greatly when first exploring data mining - but I found myself wanting to have a deeper understanding which this book so nicely provides. As Janert mentions in the first chapter, the succinct notation of mathematics is much clearer than having to try to extract the essence of twenty lines of source code. Without a doubt, though, Data Analysis is dense which and that might turn a few people off.All said and done, I'm glad I took the time to read the book and will definitely keep it nearby.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"I bought this book hoping for a reference on open source tools.  But the open source tools are a minor aspect of this book.  The core is about data analysis--and it is fantastic.  I should have known this from the title I suppose: the ""data analysis"" is in big font with a colorful background, and ""with open source tools"" is in small font--and it is literally about the same ratio with the book.  Each chapter has small section that works one example with an open source tool.  And there is a chapter at the end about the array of open source tools available.But the data analysis aspects of the book--most outstanding.  I have a master's in computer science, and do data and analytics for a living, so I have many books on the topic.  Some books with more of a theoretical and rigorous foundation, some with more of a hands-on slant.  I was expecting this book to be the latter, but it is quite the former.Yet it is still very practical.  It is not a ""theory"" work as such, just a rigorous book useful in practice (there is a big difference!).  Throughout the book the author points out the value of solving the problem at hand, rather than being excessively precise--which is the bigger risk in this domain.  Examples would be: using visuals to get a feel for data but not trying to use visuals to give precise answers (which they fundementally cannot), and using techniques that get ""close enough"" such as perturbation.And it is extremely well written.  The writing is in reasonably simple English, relative to the topic, yet not insulting or goofy the way the ""Dummies"" series can be for example.  It is easy to read yet content rich--a fantastic combination.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"I love this book on data analysis, but I do understand not everybody likes this style.From a theoretical physics background, I appreciate the book and the author a lot. The writer put a lot of effort in explaining the background on each topic from the perspective of someone who knows a bit about the topic but not in depth. People who are currently data scientists are from different technical background, and the text is a good introduction into the topics. Technical details are not overwhelming, which is good for people who can pick up the technicalities on their own through other books and the web.If one is looking for the open source tools implementation, he is certainly disappointed. (The title of the book is unfortunately misleading.) If one is looking for technical details, this is not a good option for them. However, to gain the insights and the big picture, this is the best book.The following chapters are well written:- Chapter 2 (A Single Variable: Shape and Distribution): This brings people into the style of the book, some basics to data analysis and wrangling, and an introduction to NumPy.- Chapter 8 (Models from Scaling Arguments): Mathematical modeling to data, something a lot of theorists doing!- Chapter 9 (Arguments from Probability Models).- Chapter 13 (Finding Clusters): Introduction to various clustering (unsupervised learning) techniques.- Chapter 18 (Predictive Analytics): Something hot recently. This serves a good piece of introduction to the big picture because a lot of other books are overwhelming with the technical details that we often get lost when working with these tools.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"While I'm not an expert in all the areas covered in this book, I am in a few.  In those areas, this book is really wrong -- actually doing damage wrong.For instance, when talking about regressions, the author claims that:1) ""Regression only makes sense when you want to use it as a prediction.""  This a very wrong.  Any decent Econometrics book well be almost entirely about counter examples.2) ""Linear regression is appropriate only if the data can be described as a straight line.""  The ""linear"" in linear regression doesn't mean that at all.  It just means that the form of the function must be linear in the coefficients to be calculated.  In particular, x = a + b*x + c*x^2 will fit a parabola to the data.3) ""Historically, one of the attractions of linear regression has been that it is easy to calculate.""  It's easy to calculate for a single independent variable but multivariate regression are devilishly difficult to calculate because of numerical issues.The is where I really have problems because multiple regression models are one of the most useful techniques available for understanding the effect of different factors and the author just dismisses them out of hand.There are other problems:When talking about the CDF, he defines it as the integral of the histogram.  The histogram is not the probability density function.  The PDF is defined to integrate to 1 where the histogram integrates to something else.The formula for standard deviation is wrong, the formula for exponential moving average is wrong (a typesetting problem).So, my problem is that I find a lot of problems with the portions of the book I know.  Can I trust the remainder of the book or should I be wary?  In this case, I'm wary.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"I'm a data scientist and I've had this book now for more than two years, and I find myself taking it off the shelf time and again to review a topic I haven't worked on in awhile. The main reason is because it provides straight explanations on almost any question I have regarding data analysis, data interpretation, analytics, techniques, software, and further reading. The author, a physicist by training with years of real-world experience, has a way of explaining a topic well without the formalism you would find in a textbook (and by no means do I suggest that this book can replace a textbook). But if you need to dive deeper into an area I recommend reading a few pages in this book first before you start reading a textbook. The author also shares his opinion frequently, which I find useful. Even if you disagree with it, reading it prompts you to think about a topic deeper, and that's when good things happen. I highly recommend this book, it has never disappointed me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"I've read some of the other reviews, and I do agree with most of the criticisms. There are quite a few errors in formulas and in the text, and it would've been really nice if the source codes and data files were given in a CD or were available on a website.That being said, the book addresses a lot of different topics - ranging from the introductory, freshman-level statistics to more advanced data mining and machine learning techniques, and passing through notions of design. It doesn't go in depth into each of them, but offers a fairly good overview, and references in case you're interested. Furthermore, the author gives some useful hints on how to do outside-the-box thinking and how to apply these techniques into business.Being a physics grad student, I've found many of the topics pretty much basic, but even so, I've learned a lot. Overall, a great introduction; I really hope the flaws are corrected on a future 2nd edition.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"Lucid, learned, and full of insights--a great book on a difficult subject. When I pre-ordered this title, I expected it to be more cookbook-oriented. There are certainly cookbook aspects to it, but it goes way beyond that. For one, it's deep: Janert gives you solutions, sure, but you also get considerable background to go with them. I particularly like chapter 9's sagacious treatment of probability models, especially the section on power law distributions. For another, it's comprehensive--there is a lot of material here, and it's delivered with discipline and care. You can tell that Janert really pushed himself (maybe with a bit of help from his editor) when writing this book. Finally, this book has heart. Data analysis is a means to an end (albeit a wonderful, fascinating one), and the author does his best to ensure that we the reader keep the objective in mind--to inform and enlighten--all the while ensuring that we know enough to pick the right tool for the job. Chapter 16 is another stand-out, and I especially appreciated Janert's distinction here between operational and representative reports and his point about the former: good design emphasizes the content. That's a bit of Tufte-esque advice that we would all do well to remember.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"I don't expect much when I brought the book. Part of it is that its title is a little bit vague. But it turned out that I learned quite a lot from it. Many books contain materials that one can easily find on the internet free. This book is different. It is not a reference book nor a textbook that goes through some subject systematically. It contains topics that are quite diverse and incoherent and is from the author's personal experience. However, it does not decrease its value. Instead, it adds value and makes it unqiue. It is not dry and do not filled with so-called ""humor"" or useless generic statements about the field. It is not hard to read. In fact it feels more that a peronsal journal in data analysis that the author walk with you and share his experience with you. When you finish the journey with him, you pick up a bunch of useful ideas and techniques in data analysis that you can use in your own work.

"I have been involved in a training program for graduate students (PhD and masters) in physiological sciences at the University of Arizona for a number of years.  Students involved in biomedical research regularly use statistics to analyze their data, yet understand very little about the types of tests available and the strengths and weaknesses of each.  I have found this book to be very informative as to the rationale behind using each of the various statistical approaches.  The best part for me, however, is the author's amazing creativity in adding personal vignettes to illustrate circumstances under which each type of test would be used.

"This is a very nicely written gentle introduction to statistics which is perfect for someone who needs to take a statistics class but hates math.  The author includes very little algebra (only one formula is beyond middle school math) and the allusions to higher math (calculus) are nicely hidden.  Instead of mathematical rigor the author provides a friendly conversation with some great humor.  This book works well because the writing style, pace and the order of the materials are excellentWhile there is little formal math, that does not mean that this is a cursory or trivial book.  Because I teach biostatistics I have read a lot of introductory books and the depth here is about average.  The two obvious missing points are box plots and post hoc tests when comparing sets of means.Overall the tables and graphics are plentiful and nicely done with only a few weaknesses.  Nearly all the graphics are properly rendered and well annotated but there are a couple that are not good.  For example, a couple pie charts are very hard to read because of the poor quality of the grayscale and the pseudo 3D effects on the bar charts are not good.  The tables through the body of the book are very clear and to the point.  The appendices have tables with basic information on distributions.  These could have perhaps been better handled with detailed advice on free (R or SAS Analytics U) or common software (Excel).The author does mention a few Excel functions throughout but there is not enough practical advice on how to do the tests/tasks that are brilliantly explained.While most of this book is good to excellent, there are two noteworthy flaws.  One is a fairly poor introduction to sampling distributions.  That is an important flaw that  will cause confusion over a solid chunk of the book.  The other serious issue is the author discusses rejecting vs accepting the null hypothesis.  While it is a subtle distinction to non-statisticians, the discussion should be framed as rejecting vs not rejecting the null hypothesis.  These two problems brought my review down from five to four stars.So, if you are dreading an upcoming statistics class consider getting this to entertain you as it teaches the core topics from a statistics class.  Unfortunately, especially given the cost of this book, you will need to supplement it with another book which has more advice on how to use software (like R or SAS) to do your research projects or class work.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Art of Data Analysis: How to Answer Almost Any Question Using Basic Statistics
"This book would be a great choice for a new grad student. Or maybe an undergrad. One who hasn't taken more than two stats courses yet. If they have, they'll probably be well beyond what this book will be able to convey. It starts off super-basic (no prior knowledge required), and only gets through analysis of variance and linear regression. So if you're looking for a book that will give you a comprehensive overview of a wide variety of advanced statistical methods, you'll need to look elsewhere. The word ""Bayesian"" does not appear in this book. What this book does (quite well) is give someone new to statistics an extremely gentle, readable introduction to the subject of analyzing data. By the end of it, you'll have a pretty good grasp of the fundamentals of statistics, and will know what tools might work to tackle basic research questions. There's some discussion of experimental design, and plenty of definition of important fundamental terms and concepts.One thing lacking is depth on how to DO statistical analyses. Sure, the author walks you through a bunch, but leaves out some pretty important details. She says it can all be done in Excel (and it can), but doesn't tell you what values to put in what rows and columns (though she does mention specific Excel functions at times). You'll need to figure that out on your own. She just talks about the tests at a higher level. A bit more theory based, and not infinitely practical. Still, that's not too bad. It's far better to have a book that explains the statistical theory well and omits a few details about the actual practice of statistics (which can be easily picked up just by playing with it), than to gloss over the details of how, when, and why to use certain types of analyses in the first place.Anyway, the book is good. It's readable. Straightforward. It's also funny. That helps.Personally, I would have preferred it be a bit longer, and gone into a wider variety of statistical analyses. Then it might actually help those of us in grad school struggling with making sense of GLMMs or multivariate analyses. But if it's the basics you're looking for, this would be an excellent choice.

"This is a decent book, that will help people use statistics and probability more sensibly. It uses slightly unusual examples to make its points. it is very good at making the point that planning the data to collect is more important than what you want to do with it afterwards. If anything this book is a plea for thinking before measuring anything. If a result needs complex staistical analysis (as opposed to clear descriptive graphing demonstrating either similarity or difference) to bring out its message it may well be problematic.This is actually more a book about good experimental design rather than difficult statistics. If its guidance is followed we may see fewer mismeasurements and fewer episodes of mangled statistics.The book is mainly aimed at university students, but its messages are useful to all those of us who use data in our work. That's most people these days.This book is good as far as it goes. It could be complemented by the brief classicHow to Lie with Statistics (Penguin Business) which is excellent at showing us how to avoid becoming confucesd by statistics. Jarman's book is very strong at showing readers how to get it right first time, but not so strong on showing us how to avoid being flummoxed by dubious statistics. Given the amount of dubious statistics in use in the world (see e.g. The Signal and the Noise: The Art and Science of Prediction and Ben Goldacre's Bad Pharma: How Medicine is Broken, and How We Can Fix Itit is worth noting this omission.The book does mention Bayes Theorem (conditional probabilities)It does and excellent job of linking set theory and probability together easily. I think Bayes theorem is so important a metaphor for hman thought- we revise our estimates of probability up and down as we learn more (for medics see e.g. Medical Decision Making)that it needs stressing. Timothy Childer's book Philosophy and Probability gives more depth here about how we can draw valid conclusions from data.Overall this is a good book about how to use statistics well. Its key point is always to think first about what whole you are drawing your sample from, and to always check that your sample is properly representative of what it claims to represent.Comment Comment | Permalink",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Art of Data Analysis: How to Answer Almost Any Question Using Basic Statistics
"It seems like it would be the perfect book for one audience and a rather bland and slow book for others. So... if you've struggled with statistics, don't like it, aren't interested but need to learn it, get this and the comical examples and colloquial writing style will help get you to where you want to be. If you're impatient to learn statistics, and have any scientific or mathematical background, this is going to be a slow read with a lot of skimming/skipping.Whichever audience you fall into, the examples are accurate and relate to the topics being discussed. The first example revolves around big foot and camera selection and the statistics concepts covered are blocking, replication, random samples and random sampling. Again, the example is related well to statistics topics at hand, but the page space dedicated to big foot is likely a distraction for one group, and a hook for another.It is engaging and of the right technical depth that you will learn the concepts, without getting too bogged down in the details (proofs and equations). That's not to say that you do not get equations, but it does mean that the primary focus is on concepts and application as opposed to solving equations by hand.The main downside regardless of audience is the text book like price, so grab it for Kindle, get it used.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Art of Data Analysis: How to Answer Almost Any Question Using Basic Statistics

"I have a security background but malware analysis in general is very new to me. But this book is extremely easy to read and at the same time very detailed. I am third into the book and it’s extremely easy to pick up, and at the same time it also seems to contain stuff that other malware analysis book I have with me doesn’t have. The authors claim to introduce many undocumented tips and tricks to ease analysis and I can definitely see them, and these tricks do make detecting and analyzing malwares easier.The other thing that I liked is how the various chapters and parts are structured. Like the part where they first talk about OS internals in simple layman terms to the next part where the authors talk about the various malware components, while parallely introducing tools and exercises and malware samples on how to detect such malware components, combining multiple static and dynamic analysis techniques.I was roughly skimming through the reverse engineering part yet(I don’t need it for my work), but I do see that their Chapter 16 is 100+ pages. Looking forward to covering those chapters as well sometime in the future, once I try out all the exercises in the book and analyze more samples. Shoutout to the chapters on their fileless malwares.And lastly thanks for the exercise samples provided. I have read many other books, and a lot of them don’t even provide exercise samples.

"Data visualization is a broad area and graphic communication broader yet. In a newspaper alone the latter might include photos, puzzles, cartoons, and advertisements as well as graphs and maps. In practice authors Friendly and Wainer are most interested in statistical graphs and maps, and less interested in information graphics or any other kind of graphics beyond that.A poignant detail: the authors met as undergraduates in 1962, so have known each other nearly 60 years. Both are strongly statistically minded, with shared major interests in psychology, but each has experience and expertise across several application fields. Wainer is well known for many short papers on graphics in journals such as The American Statistician, Chance and Significance, most of which have been gathered in five previous books.  Friendly is a leading authority on graphics for categorical data and has also written several substantial papers on the history of graphics. In coming together for this book they offer a highly readable overview of many of the highlights in the history of statistical graphics, which will be widely appreciated as intriguing and informative.The title detail ""A History"" is crucial. The authors could have written a book 2 or 3 times the length of this from their own previous papers. For that reason and others, this is emphatically a selective history with no intent or pretense at completeness. The authors are cheerfully historical in setting contributions in their contemporary context, and equally cheerfully unhistorical in hailing heroes retrospectively and judging past work in the light of the present, making gleeful anachronistic comments along the way on crowd sourcing and grant applications. Indeed, some of the most striking detail arises from exercises re-plotting historic data with modern tools. After an inevitably bitty start, the main focus is on such workers as the peripatetic van Langren; Guerry, Minard, and Marey in France; and  Playfair, Herschel, Farr, Snow, and Galton in Britain. Later developments in North America are not neglected.Enormous scope remains for future work. The authors mention a golden age for graphics in the 19th century, but elsewhere I have mentioned a golden age starting around 1970 first centered on Princeton, Bell Labs, and Harvard and the work of Tukey, Tufte, Cleveland, Chambers, and others, which combined inventiveness in graph designs with modern computing. As is well known, magnificent progress in hardware and software over a few decades took graphs away from specialists in drawing offices and gave their control to scientists, statisticians, and others working at their own computers. Some of this later 20th century work -- especially interactive and dynamic graphics -- is mentioned here. There is continuing need for detailed historical analysis of the ways in which statistical graphics (and exploratory data analysis more generally) both challenged and complemented then current approaches to statistics. Graphical depiction of uncertainty is another understated theme. Who first plotted error bars anywhere? The history of that idea appears to be undocumented in any sustained form.The authors score high on enthusiasm, entertainment, and enterprise. They and close colleagues have unearthed much splendid work otherwise gathering dust in libraries and archives, at least metaphorically.  Unfortunately copy editing and proof-reading has left a peppering of small errors and a few outright howlers. Greek, Latin, German, and French names are the most frequent casualties, but some British details are mangled too, as when Newton's work on calculus is misplaced by a century and Galton's focus on regression to mediocrity is reported in terms of mediocracy, itself a much needed gap in political life. The authors' references are sometimes capricious, missing entire monographs on Playfair, Herschel, Snow, Minard and the history of Venn diagrams, for example. Perhaps these errors and omissions will be made good in the accompanying website.There was one major disappointment for me. Unlike those in many books in the history of cartography (let alone the history of art), the illustrations are mostly small and often a muddy black and white, with only a short selection in color. It seems that the publishers missed an opportunity for a bold publication that would have appealed widely, far beyond the small number of specialists in this territory.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A History of Data Visualization and Graphic Communication
"We take for granted the charts, graphs, and maps that pervade in news reports and journal articles. The Covid pandemic has been a story told by graphics on dashboards and the nightly news. This book is both a history of those tools and a primer on their use. As public data began to be accumulated in the 19th century (there is a pre-history but, that's OK) the problem of how to both see and understand large datasets in economics and medicine gave rise to statistical methods whose results needed to be communicated. That was and is the role of these graphic forms and their discovery teaches much about their utility and their limits. The whole is told in a language that is direct, non-technical and thus accessible to any general reader. And for those with an interest, even passing, in both the subjects being charted, graphed, or mapped the history provides not only background but context for the work being done today.

"Kleppmann mentioned during his ""Turning the Database Inside Out with Apache Samza"" talk at Strange Loop 2014 (see my notes) that he was on sabbatical working on this book, and while waiting quite some time for it to be published, I ended up experimenting with his Bottled Water project as well as Apache Kafka (which was only at release 0.8.2.2 at that point in time). Other reviewers are correct that much of the material included in this book is available elsewhere, but this book is packaged well (although still at 550-pages and heavyweight), with most of the key topics associated with data-intensive applications under one roof with good explanations and numerous footnotes which point to resources providing additional detail.Content is broken down into 3 sections and 12 chapters: (1) foundations of data systems, which covers reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications, data models and query languages, storage and retrieval, and encoding and evolution, (2) distributed data, which covers replication, partitioning, transactions, the trouble with distributed systems, and consistency and consensus, and (3) derived data, which covers batch processing, stream processing, and the future of data systems. The latter 6 chapters are weighted more heavily, with chapter 9 on consistency and consensus, and chapter 12 on the future of data systems, the most lengthy with each comprising about 12% of the book.Some potential readers might be disappointed that this book is all theory, but while the author does not provide any code he discusses practical implementation and specific details when applicable for comparisons within a product category. In my opinion, the last chapter is probably the most abstract simply because it explores ideas about how the tools covered in the prior two chapters might be used in the future to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications. Similiary, the chapter on the opposite end of this book sets the stage well for any developer of nontrivial applications with its section on thinking about database systems and the concerns around reliability, scalability, and maintainability.About a year ago, I recall an executive colleague responding to me with a quizzical look when I mentioned that tooling for data and application development is converging over time, and just a few months prior I mentioned in a presentation to developers that transactional and analytical capabilities are being provided more and more by single database products, with one executive in the audience shaking his head in disagreement that kappa rather than lambda architectures are the way to go. Kleppman mentions that we typically think of databases, message brokers, caches, etc as residing in very different categories of tooling because each of these has very different access patterns, meaning different performance characteristics and therefore different implementations.So why should all of this tooling not be lumped together under an umbrella term such as 'data systems'? Many products for data storage and processing have emerged in recent years, optimized for a variety of use cases and no longer neatly fitting into traditional categories: the boundaries between categories are simply becoming blurred, and since a single tool can no longer satisfy the data processing and storage needs for many applications, work is broken down into tasks that can be performed efficiently on a single system that is often comprised of different tooling stitched together by application code under the covers.In addition to the author's abundant and effective simple line diagrams that are reminiscent (although more sophisticated) of his earlier diagrams, one aspect that I especially appreciate is the nomenclature comparisons between products when walking through terminology. For example, at the beginning of chapter 6, the author specifically calls out the terminological confusion that exists with respect to partitioning. ""What we call a 'partition' here is called a 'shard' in MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and SolrCloud; it's known as a 'region' in HBase, a 'tablet' in Bigtable, a 'vnode' in Cassandra and Riak, and a 'vBucket' in Couchbase. However, partitioning is the most established term, so we'll stick to that.""In addition, Kleppmann walks through differences between products when the same terminology is being used, which can also lead to confusion. For example, in chapter 7 the author provides a great 5-page discussion on the meaning of ""ACID"" (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability), which was an effective reminder to me that while this term was coined in 1983 in an effort to establish precise terminology for fault-tolerance mechanisms in databases, in practice one database's implementation of ACID does not equal another's implementation. ""Today, when a system claims to be 'ACID compliant', it's unclear what guarantees you can actually expect. ACID has unfortunately become mostly a marketing term.""If you've ever found yourself confused about the concept of ""consistency"", the author offers a sanity check that your confusion is warranted, not only because the term is ""terribly overloaded"" with at least four different meanings, but because ""the letter C doesn't really belong in ACID"" since it was ""tossed in to make the acronym work"" in the original paper, and that ""it wasn't considered important at the time."" The reality is that ""atomicity, isolation, and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency (in the ACID sense) is a property of the application. The application may rely on the database's atomicity and isolation properties in order to achieve consistency, but it's not up to the database alone.""An later in chapter 9 where he discusses consistency and consensus, the author provides a great sidebar on ""the unhelpful CAP theorem"". As Kleppmann later comments, ""the CAP theorem as formally defined is of very narrow scope: it only considers one consistency model (namely linearizability) and one kind of fault (network partitions, or nodes that are alive but disconnected from each other). It doesn't say anything about network delays, dead nodes, or other trade-offs. Thus, although CAP has been historically influential, it has little practical value for designing systems.""The author concludes in a sidebar by commenting that ""all in all, there is a lot of misunderstanding and confusion around CAP, and it does not help us understand systems better, so CAP is best avoided."" This is because ""CAP is sometimes presented as 'Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance: pick 2 out of 3'. Unfortunately, putting it this way is misleading because network partitions are a kind of fault, so they aren't something about which you have a choice: they will happen whether you like it or not...A better way of phrasing CAP would be 'either Consistent or Available when Partitioned'. A more reliable network needs to make this choice less often, but at some point the choice is inevitable.""While the second section of this text on distributed data was most beneficial to me, the third section on derived data was least beneficial, mainly because I'm already familiar with these topics from recent readings and experience, and because I needed to refamiliarize myself with the content discussed in the second section. However, the author presents derived data well, and I certainly do not recommend skipping this section. As Kleppmann comments, the issues around integrating multiple different data systems into one coherent application architecture is often overlooked by vendors who claim that their product can satisfy all of your needs. In reality, integrating disparate systems (which can be grouped into the two broad categories of ""systems of record"" and ""derived data systems"") is one of the most important things that needs to be done in a nontrivial application. I highly recommend this text.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems"
"Designing Data-Intensive Applications really exceeded my expectations. Even if you are experienced in this area this book will re-enforce things you know (or sort of know) and bring to light new ways of thinking about solving distributed systems and data problems. It will give you a solid understanding of how to choose the right tech for different use cases.The book really pulls you in with an intro that is more high level, but mentions problems and solutions that really anyone who has worked on these types of applications have either encountered or heard mention of. The promise it makes is to take these issues such as scalability, maintainability and durability and explain how to decide on the right solutions to these issues for the problems you are solving. It does an amazing job of that throughout the book.This book covers a lot, but at the same time it knows exactly when to go deep on a subject. Right when it seems like it may be going too deep on things like how different types of databases are implemented (SSTables, B-trees, etc.) or on comparing different consensus algorithms, it is quick to point out how and why those things are important to practical real-world problems and how understanding those things is actually vital to the success of a system.Along those same lines it is excellent at circling back to concepts introduced at prior points in the book. For example the book goes into how log based storage is used for some databases as their core way of storing data and for durability in other cases. Later in the book when getting into different message/eventing systems such as Kafka and ActiveMQ things swing back to how these systems utilize log based storage in similar ways. Even if you have prior knowledge or even have worked with these technologies, how and why they work and the pros and cons of each become crystal clear and really solidified. Same can be said of it's great explanations of things like ZooKeeper and why specific solutions like Kafka make use of it.This book is also amazing at shedding light on the fact that so little of what is out there is totally new, it attempts to go back as far as it can at times on where a certain technology's ideas originated (back to the 1800s at some points!). Bringing in this history really gives a lot of context around the original problems that were being solved, which in turn helps understanding pros and cons. One example is the way it goes through the history of batch processing systems and HDFS. The author starts with MapReduce and relating it to tech that was developed decades before. This really clarifies how we got from batch processing systems on proprietary hardware to things like MapReduce on commodity hardware thanks in part to HDFS, eventually to stream based processing. It also does great at explaining the pros and cons of each and when one might choose one technology over the other.That's really the theme of this book, teaching the reader how to compare and contrast different technologies for solving distributed systems and data problems. It teaches you to read between the lines on how certain technologies work so that you can identify the pros and cons early and without needing them to be spelled out by the authors of those technologies. When thinking about databases it teaches you to really consider the durability/scalability model and how things are no where near black and white between ""consistent"" vs ""eventually consistent"", these is a ton of nuance there and it goes deep on things like single vs multi leader vs leaderless, linearizability, total order broadcast, and different consensus algorithms.I could go on forever about this book. To name a few other things it touches on to get a good idea of the breadth here: networking (and networking faults), OLAP, OLTP, 2 phase locking, graph databases, 2 phase commit, data encoding, general fault tolerance, compatibility, message passing, everything I mentioned above, and the list goes on and on and on. I recommend anyone who does any kind of work with these systems takes the time to read this book.

It really is that good.The front pages contain a quote from Alan Kay that I will summarize as ""most people who write code for money ... have no idea where [their culture came from]."" This book will learn you some of the culture you are missing! Every developer writing modern Internet facing application software, particularly in cloud computing environments, will run into the problems described here. Far too many of these developers will pick up a grab bag of half baked solutions from reading various Stack Overflow posts, blogs from better informed writers, and from hyped up claims made by the currently trendy ""technologies.""  Many of these sources will obscure the fundamental nature of the underlying problems, and will lead said developers to overly naive designs, and provide a false sense of security. Such systems will even work pretty nicely for a while, but they will usually fail spectacularly when they are actually presented with component failures or high system load (or both at the same time, which is quite typical).This book talks about the underlying structure of the problems we all face when building contemporary distributed applications. It ties together all the foundational aspects of both distributed computing and data storage in a chorent manner. It teaches you how to think about the problem space by demonstrating where many popular and widely used software products fit. You're not going to learn about any one single product. Instead you will learn what you must know to evaluate as many of them as you want, learn which interactions between different components matter, and then make informed choices for your own design.This is not an academic text book, it is a working professional's guide to the field.

It’s vertically and horizontally broad in that it develops a good understanding of theory with application examples.  The book has a good presentation of concepts, interesting material that is diverse, but the learning curve is not short – but neither is it discouraging.  I found myself drawn in with each chapter even though I didn’t read them sequentially as I’d read the first edition some time ago.  Contemporary issues are presented with some results challenging conventional wisdom.  It will show how your lack of understanding increases your susceptibility to the many analysis that have been wrongly interpreted.  The updated and additional models are worth the read covering bad statistics, risk assessment, decision analysis, hypothesis testing, reliability modeling or forensic and legal evidence reasoning.  Certainly, in this list of topics, several you may find appealing.  More importantly, for serious practitioners having the software and examples combine to make this a good read but excellent learning tool.  I have used this professionally for financial analysis, product performance assessment, and business decision making.  I also urge you to consider the additional readings and publications provided at the end of each chapter.The book is well worth it – when the 3rd edition is published – I’ll buy that one too.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Risk Assessment and Decision Analysis with Bayesian Networks

"This book overall is excellent if you have a background in statistics. I can't imagine the introductory chapter on univariate statistics is sufficient for understanding the complexity of regression models covered later in the book, for instance survival analysis. I would not recommend this book for someone without a background in regression models.A small criticism is that though the author does discuss the assumption of regression models, he does not go into great detail on the diagnostic methods. For someone trying these models for the first time, this could lead to error if you do not look elsewhere for more info.Application of analytic models is the theme of this book, and in that regard it excels. My doctorate included several biostatistics and epidemiology courses, and this book was excellent in providing new extensions of those methods to marketing and showing me how to think like a marketer. I also learned plenty of new things, like latent class analysis for segmentation, and simultaneous equations, which were fun chapters.The book is well written for a fast read. The author intentionally does not go into detail on equations, which is nice for application, less so for thorough understanding. Plenty of resources are recommended in-text though to find greater detail.If you want a book that will introduce you to the application of several analytic marketing methods, many of which are drawn from biostatistics and econometrics, this book is great read.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Marketing Analytics: A Practical Guide to Improving Consumer Insights Using Data Techniques
"A bit of a strange book, confused as to its audience. Maybe.It's a bit like that college professor that covers the basic material just cause the department makes it so, then proceeds to hammer you with terse explanations and somewhat unhelpful generalizations.Listen to this, the author spends ten pages covering all of statistics from the basic definition of means all the way to probability. Yeah, and that's fine but why waste that space when you then spend 6 pages explaining what panel regression is and how to use it? And by the way, half of those pages are just tables of statistical output...And so on for most of the chapters.You do get the sense that the author is overly concerned with breadth rather than depth, and it shows in how shallow some of his chapter read. It's basically a survey of methods rather than a textbook approach to marketing analytics.The last chapter where he recounts personal experiences in his career all the way from shoe salesman to Ph.D. in tensor analysis is pretty darn good and great practical advice.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Marketing Analytics: A Practical Guide to Improving Consumer Insights Using Data Techniques

"I had the second version of this book and it was the primary text for my Generalized Linear Model (GLM) course. I recently purchased the new version after reading about some of the differences between the two. I'll discuss my thoughts shortly.First off, this book is another must have for those who will not only practice statistical modeling of categorical data, but who also need to be able understand the mathematical underpinnings of the GLM and the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). Chapter 4, in particular, reviews the components of the GLM - systematic and random components, and the link function - and then goes on to explain what how these three differ depending on the type of your response (""y""): continuous data, binary data, count data, and so fourth. The next few chapters then go into detail on more of the application of the GLM for each of these type of data, followed by chapters discussing different models for GLMM - when your response variable is correlated. Finally, the book reviews asymptotic theory (chapter 16) which is vital for understanding how sample size affects the results for these models. For me, this book is does a better job at explaining these kind of topics (particularly, the Delta Method) than Casella, which is also an important book. Despite the emphasis on theory, there are applied examples and problems and the author does provide code for R, SAS, and Stata on his website.The main differences between this version and the second version are threefold. First, there are two additional chapters: one chapter devoted to other ways to model binary data and one based on other model approaches to classifying and clustering data. For the former, Agresti expanded coverage on probit regression, which is like a logistic regression but using a different distribution assumption. It also discusses topics that have become of interest in the last ten to fifteen years such as high dimensional analysis. The other new chapter discusses methods such as decision trees and linear discriminant analysis. Next, some chapters also include a discussion on bayesian approaches to the GLM, including the alternative approach to modeling binary data that I mentioned. Finally, the problem sets have been partly changed. I feel like the classification and clustering topics are better covered in a book like Johnson's Multivariate Data Analysis, and much of the new material feels more like an overview than a rigorous discussion of the math like other parts of the book. On the positive side, I thought that the section on probit regression was good because it provided insight on its importance in latent modeling.Despite my critiques this is still an excellent book to own. If you already own the second edition, I can't recommend purchasing this book but if you don't then you definitely should.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Categorical Data Analysis
"Undoubtedly, it is a classical textbook in categorical data analysis.  But there are some drawbacks in the book I'd like to point out.Frist, if you are a self-learner, you'd better choose another textbook with a more smooth learning curve. In some of the chapters, you might encounter some classical or even deemed ""trivial"" examples to illustrate some basic concepts, then delve into the technical part where has nothing but the mathematical proofs. Though proofs in this book are not assuming the readers have mastery of measure theory, many of them require readers to have a grasp of exponential family, canonical link, which are often introduced in graduate-level statistical classes. Another textbook "" An introduction to categorical data analysis"", by the same author, will be a better choice.Also, this textbook is too oriented towards the application of statistical methods to bio-industries, which I find it not very enjoyable. I admit that similar approaches can also be applied to other fields as long as you have a deep understanding of them. But for people who just want learn methods that they can immediately put them into practice. This book doesn't serve well for them.Last but not least, the practice problems don't relate to the textbook materials well. For sure, you can easily crack the first few practice problems without even reading that chapter. As you move on,  many of the questions are becoming quite formidable. One reason is that some of them were drawing from Agresti's research, which assumes a high-level mastery of statistical methods and probability.I'd like to see a few changes, as I mentioned above could be incorporated into the fourth edition.

"I'm a computational scientist who has been teaching myself these methods for my work. I don't have a formal statistics background, other than reading/studying Hogg & Craig Intro to Mathematical Statistics, and also Kutner Applied Linear Regression Models. This book is really smooth reading, especially compared to Hogg & Craig, which would often leave me puzzling over a page for hours. I rarely puzzle over a page in Agresti because it's so well done.  It's less mathy/rigorous than the Hogg/Craig, because the focus is much more on applications. But it's much more rigorous and therefore (to me) useful than the Kutner book which is entirely applications and pretty cookbook-ish.  Occasionally he'll just state a formula and just give a citation, but when it's an important one he derives it.For me, how Agresti wrote it is the most efficient way to get the needed information into my brain.

"A practical, inspirational guide for human resources (HR) professionals, this book sets out to show how data collected by a company can be utilised to improve the HR function and, in turn, the company-as-a-whole. It is a lot more than just storing HR information on a computer, yet many professionals have yet to see the utility and potential of data-driven HR. A book like this can change that!Such data usage should be carefully considered, carried out responsibly. Getting it wrong can create many problems for a company as well as possibly invoking some harsh words and a penalty from a judge. HR also has a strategic role, doing more than just aiding the recruitment process and dealing with the day-to-day problems that the company may face. HR can be central to businesses development, coordinating and identifying training, supporting performance management, engaging employees and much more; connecting it to the power of data should be just a win-win. But do it right!.The book delivers a lot of enthusiastic and inspirational information, aided with the right amount of theory, a lot of practical advice and some case studies to show how some of the bits can fit together in a realistic, real-world situation. For what you get for the immensely reasonable price tag, it is a literal, literary steal. For those who are sceptical about where the data can be found or how it can be connected for greater exploitation, this is covered, and more, and naturally, the various legislation and best practices that surround such usage help shape and guide the plans.A wise company executive or manager who is not focussed on HR can also get some benefit from this book since its multidisciplinary reach is more than capable of brushing up a bit of knowledge here and there and possibly loosening additional beneficial thought processes.

"An excellent job done by the authors. As with the first edition, Powers and Xie make the analysis of categorical data easy to understand. There are 7 chapters that are clearly written, begining with a review of simple linear regression, then going to loglinear models for contingency tables, models for ordinal and nominal dependent variables and models for event ocurrence (models for rates). The technical level is high enough to understand the theory behind the analysis and the interpretation of results. The inclusion of a new chapeter (ch.5) on multilevel models is very clearly written, and includes a short introduction to modern Bayesian modelling. Although there is not enough space for a complete introduction into this topic (which requires a high level of mathematical statistics) the authors refer to other books (like the one by Scott Lynch) for more detailed explanations (needed for a better understanding) of bayesian modelling in general.

But then it just moves on to the next data structure. This is of absolutely no use. There needs to be at least a page after each data structure, which outlines how to use it.If this book included this, I would rate it 5 stars. But without it, it is utterly useless.

"I have nothing to compare this to, but I think the text certainly attains its stated goals, which is to help researches gain an insight into many useful statistical methods without knowing the theory behind it.  While I agree that I would love to have the theory presented as well, the fact of the matter is as long as you pay close attention to the limitations stated in the text, you can get by without knowing the theory for a lot of analysis if you are using a decent statistical software package.It ultimately comes down to what you need to do.  If you have a pretty good statistical program that does the calculations for you, then this book is quite useful, and in fact will allow you to apply statistical methods over a broader range, much quicker than if you learn the underlying theory and use something like Matlab to write your own calculations for the same methods.  If you are going into a profession for long term data analysis, this would be an excellent place to start because the focus is on practicality and case studies so you can see what the methods are used for (i.e. see the ""forest"" through the ""trees"").However, the next step after this book would be something deeper on the calculus derivations for regression and further exploration into stated assumptions violations such as independence and constant variance.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Statistical Sleuth: A Course in Methods of Data Analysis
"The author is clearly expert in statistical analysis. He succeeds in introducing statistics as an entity unto itself, rather than a little understood and oft-misused tool by scientists. This book is intended for serious scientific minds who want to understand the elements of statistical thought and analytics. Chapters utilize published scientific papers to explore statistical concepts and teach appropriate applications. It is here, unfortunately, that the book falls quite short. In treating statistics as the science it is, the author presumes too much on the part of the student. It is akin to a beginning cell biology student sitting through a series of advanced molecular genetics seminars. The explanations of many concepts presume too much fundamental knowledge or provide insufficient detail to be able to follow the essential thought processes. The organization of the book is also problematic, one chapter does not always follow from the one preceding it. Each chapter is accompanied by 25 - 35 practical exercises, and data sets are available for download to use with these exercises. In addition there are approximately a dozen quiz questions per chapter. Unfortunately, solutions are not available for the exercises, only answers for the quiz questions. It is a noble attempt, but one which remains far short of its goal as an introductory text book.

There are plenty of bibliographic references if you want to follow up in-depth.Be prepared to spend a fair amount of time digesting this material. The discussion is often terse and the explanations of some theory are are bit brief; hence the 4 star review. The code examples are very helpful in understanding what the authors are talking about.

However, only one chapter of  “Bayesian Data Analysis in Ecology” is ecology-focused - and even that material is useful to a non-ecologist, as an example of a complex BUGS or STAN model. Nor is the book relevant just for people interested in Bayesian statistics - again, Bayesian matters account for only a small proportion of the total page count, in the book's final chapters. What I see is a gentle, nicely presented, R-illustrated intermediate-level course in mixed models, which feels like an extension of “Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models” by Gelman and Hill. Just like that book is Bayesian only where it needs to be, “Bayesian Data Analysis in Ecology” does not focus on Bayesian methods, but introduces Bayesian analyses after a tour of the “mainstream” aproach. The overall impression is very positive, and it is unfortunate that the book's reach may be limited by the accurate-yet-too-specific title, and the publisher's rather greedy pricing.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bayesian Data Analysis in Ecology Using Linear Models with R, BUGS, and Stan"

Having said that, I think the material could have been covered in more detail, in half the pages.I feel that you could look at the book table of contents, and find the material yourself for each chapter.Some complaints- book gives a lot of information (e.g. about the parameters of a function) in a long paragraph instead of a bullet form.- lot's of space (pages) filled with pointless tables, some longer than they need to be to make the point, all with normal size font.- lot of things are explained using some pretty big tables with hundreds or more rows.  Why ?  Author couldn't be bothered to make some smaller CSV files ?- Feels like the author has struggled to fill the pages in the book.  There is a chapter dedicated to STRING FORMATTING and REGEX .. nothing really to do with a Pandas book.  Other chapters give examples of things are that fairly obscure - such as all kinds of plots such as violin plots, instead of actually explaining plots in a concise manner -  or obscure cases that you would rarely encounter, and if you did, this book would not be a good reference either way.- Another example of filler material, Chapter 5 is about ""missing data"", and there's a section that shows you where it could come from, and chapter 5.3.2 ( 2 pages), is really an exact repeat of the tables from the section on merging .. because those examples tables contain missing data.

"I'm a Data Scientist for a large bank, also currently pursuing a Masters in DS. I've tried to slog through any number of Python/R/Data Science books and usually can barely crack the first 100 pages. First of all, they all seem to be compelled to drag me through numpy. I get it. Everything is based on numpy. But I rarely use numpy iRL! In short, most of the authors take 600 pages to say what they can easily get to in 200 and change.Daniel's book is a breath of fresh air. He still manages to educate without getting bogged down in the minutia or the overly verbose theory, math, etc. etc. The chapters cut right to the chase of what you need to know to become expert at pandas (as well as seaborn and other nifty libraries) while also providing Data Science-applicable foundations (tidy data, visualizations, etc.).Also worth mentioning is the companion information available on his github repo.

"Getting into the world of data analytics and data science can daunting.

He makes early use of data visualization which is a wonderful way to teach, as seeing the results of the analysis in a graphical way complements the tabular results from Pandas (which is a wonderful tool).I like this book so much it's becoming a little worn around the edges, as I take it with me while travelling on business (my day job is cybersecurity) and I can see many applications for pandas to summarize, present and search for outliers in a large amount of security data.Several topics which really confused me for a long time became clear in minutes with this book, which is a testament to a good writer - there are not just examples; there are the right examples that illustrate how to do something and the kind of trap you can fall into when you do it wrong.I've just bought the kindle version to complement my paper copy, something I rarely do, but this book is worth it!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pandas for Everyone: Python Data Analysis (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)

"Algorithms is the type of subject that can make you put your hand on your head in frustration due to the technical nature of the subject. This book does a terrific job of demystifying topics and giving you a clear and concise notion of the fundamentals which make the algorithm work. In turn, the authors have gotten me to love learning about algorithms. Every chapter is a new challenge, and the authors are there to help guide you the whole way.Cormen's Algorithms book is highly regarded as one of the best algorithms book out there, and though I have no experience with any other algorithms texts, it's fairly obvious to me now why that is true. Cormen's book is mostly well-organized, is easily readable (especially with all the great pictures and examples!), and is best used as a workbook text. Pretty much all of the chapters rely on chapters previous to some degree, and the exercises especially reflect this behavior as many of them require you to you optimization learned in previous chapters to modify current algorithms. Overall, I have very few complaints, and this text has been one of my favorites throughout college.My first complaint is that the text begins by throwing you in to the analysis of insertion sort before defining any notation or mathematics used to analyze the algorithm. While I understand that the idea is to introduce you to what algorithm analysis really is, the chapter felt more confusing than helpful. I would much rather the book started with background information first.Secondly, the mathematical chapters are very brief and vague. Chapters 4 and 5 are particularly bad due to the lack of depth, explanation, and clarity. The examples are far from satisfactory, particularly those regarding probability and recurrences. While these chapters had excellent problem sets, I needed an external source to help me deal with cases not covered in the text. One example of a topic I had trouble with was solving for the number of levels a recurrence tree has. The book only presents trivial examples of this while the problem sets ask for significantly more work. One or two worked out examples, even if they were only included in the selected answers, would have been very helpful.The last issue that I had with the book was the lack of explanation given in the analysis of specific algorithms. For example, the runtime analysis of Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm felt far from intuitive. The author does not take enough time to explain where some analysis techniques came from and why they were used. Though many of the algorithms are discussed in enough detail, there are several more advanced algorithms which feel like they were thrown into the text without enough care.Despite all these issues I've been very pleased with my purchase and the time I've invested in it. I would recommend the book to anyone with interest in algorithms. While some knowledge of basic mathematical analysis and probability theory would be helpful, it's pretty easy to get by without either of these. Though the explanation of some of the more technical parts of the book is lacking, the authors do a great job of translating complicated psuedo-code and notational necessities into something which is very easy to understand",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (The MIT Press)"
"I am a math major who has taken a few cs courses from the cs department at my university. Up until reading this book cs has always been a bit of a mystery to me. I have heard a million and one time how cs is based on mathematics but aside from understanding the idea of traversing through arrays as you would the indexes of a sequence, I have never really seen the connection between the two subjects. This book does an amazing job of demonstrating the mathematical basis of cs. From the very beginning when the authors deconstruct the for-loop used in a insert-sort into a variation on mathematical induction the lines between the two subjects are made crystal clear.I would agree that a pretty solid understanding of mathematics is required for this book, and I can see why someone coming from a typical undergraduate education in cs would find it difficult and intimidating to tackle this book. It definitely does not teach you how to program or the basics of object oriented design as it proceeds to teach you about structure and design of algorithms. I can also understand why someone hoping to simply get a job as a ""programmer"" or ""software engineer"" would not necessarily be well served by this book. The authors are very upfront on this note though, and specifically warn prospective students that they are not going to teach them how to ""code"" solutions to common cs problems. What they are going to teach them is the fundamentals of algorithm analysis and design. How valuable prospective students find this approach is going to depend entirely on what exactly they hope to do with their understanding of computer science. If you want to learn how to code and be paid to be a developer (not a bad line of work by any stretch of the imagination) you might want to look else where.For someone coming from a mathematics background though (whether it's an applied field such as statistics or numerical analysis or a pure field like abstract algebra or analysis) this is an excellent introduction to the field of computer science. If you are coming from a math background the analysis and structure of algorithms as presented in this book will instantly click. For me personally I loved the fact that the underlining mathematical basis of cs did not get lost in details of coding or working within certain developmental environments like Eclipse. Again, probably not an ideal choice for someone looking to learn this particular subjects, but definitely a good choice for math majors (or prospective cs grad students).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (The MIT Press)"

"I'll keep this review fairly short as specific examples of where this book fails is touched on by other reviewers instead.As far as textbooks go, this is a fairly good one.

This could easily be a 5 star book if the entire book was written to the same standard. I've stumbled upon incomplete sections with incorrect code (like the example of algorithm where a loop terminates upon the queue being empty, but literally no text or code that actually suggests dequeuing thus running forever), badly ambiguously written exercises, and general lack of clarity in certain sections.One reviewer pointed out there were 4 authors on this book, so I could speculate that they are not all writing to the same standard.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (The MIT Press)"
"This was bought for an undergraduate course in Analysis of Algorithms.While the book definitely is a good book and is the go-to book for algorithms courses, it actually is more of a graduate level book.As my professor explains it, it is a very mathy book and is not suited well for undergraduate (even though he made us undergraduates get it...), it's only use in undergrad is the fact you can get it while in undergrad and take it with you to graduate school.So what makes undergraduate different from graduate to make this book suited for graduate level courses?Undergraduate: Don't care about proofs or the math part, just wanna know the algorithms at a basic understanding without knowing the reason the algorithm even works at the math level. Most professors can just teach the material straight up no book for undergraduate courses honestly, the professors got PHDs they can give undergraduate level explanations on the fly.Graduate: You are required to give mathematical proofs in graduate level courses, and are expected to know the algorithm at the deepest math level. Because of the work load, this is where this book shines because the professor cannot spend everyday till midnight teaching each student how to prove every algorithm, so this book is very well suited for graduate level because it is VERY math oriented.This is a book that focuses on the math of the algorithm, but that's not entirely bad because undergraduates still may be interested in that stuff, my course just doesn't care about the proofs because there already is a graduate course for the ones in the Master's program.As for the actual content and how easy it is to understand for an undergraduate... Well I do plan to go for PHD and this book has been very helpful for that because I am motivated to take the next step.

"Was this expensive? Yes. Was it overpriced? No.My algorithms class was hard (what algorithms class isn't), and I'm not always an ideal student.

Turns out the class average was 45/100, and I had the highest grade in the class.Pretty crazy, right? WRONG! Exam 2 was where things got crazy.

After attending office hours before exam 2, I found out that almost everyone else was finding the answers online and copying them for good homework grades.

"I just finished an undergrad-level college course that used this book (3rd edition). Extremely in-depth on the topics that it covers, using formal mathematical notation throughout to present the algorithms. As many others have said, it's very math-heavy and I'd recommend that anyone thinking about learning from this book should already have a strong background in especially discrete math, but should also have some familiarity with single-variable calculus and probability. The appendices do a brief math review (on discrete math & probability) but are not a substitute for learning the math for the first time.The book is essentially best described as a detailed, mathematically-oriented analysis of algorithmic theory and covers a wide variety of topics. Proofs of various concepts are built up with lemmas throughout as well, and many of the exercises in the book often ask for a proof to show that something is correct. The authors do provide a Solutions file online, but for only some exercises up through chapter 26 when it has 35 chapters.The book more than ""combines rigor and comprehensiveness"" as it says on the back, and it will almost certainly be an indispensable reference in the future for anyone planning to work (or is already working) in a computer science-related field, but it also has some notable drawbacks as well, not the least of which is the title. A genuine ""Introduction"" to algorithms would've been either more accessible (with less math) or substantially shorter (at approximately half the page count or less), or both. As it is, the book's title could have more accurately reflected its density with something more like ""Algorithm Theory In Depth"" or ""Algorithm Analysis"". Fortunately the book includes an extensive index that lists out nearly every sub-topic that it covers for quick reference.Some of the notable drawbacks include:- It often shows that it was written by 4 different authors, as some topics are explained better than others (the graph algorithms overall were explained well) while others lacked sufficient clarity (recurrence relations, sorting in general, greedy algorithms, amortized analysis, NP completeness).- Like many other academia-oriented textbooks, it suffers from overuse of the infamous pretentious phrase ""it is easy to see,"" paticularly when it's not easy to see what the author is talking about.- Chapter 4 suffers from a lack of explanation on solving recurrences by the recursion-tree and substitution methods, with insufficient examples.- No exercises or content to help with actually implementing an algorithm in a programming language, because putting an algorithm into practice should be just as important as the theory.- The authors write in the preface that the book is aimed at teachers, students, professionals, & their colleagues (!). A book that attempts to cater to both students and the authors' colleagues at the same time would appear to be paradoxical, right?- Dry, dispassionate wording that fails to inspire the reader to continue reading the text, and continue learning past this book as well.Despite the drawbacks it's a good, very dense & in-depth reference on the subject, but for those learning algorithms for the first time, I'd recommend one of these other books first that explain the concepts more clearly in plain English and then coming back to CLRS afterwards. Just pick the one based on the language you're most familiar with. I own copies of all of these books btw (a few in digital formats, not all of them in print) and can personally speak to their quality in offering clearer, easier-to-understand explanations of algorithms.-

"I think this is a pretty good book that is easy to read if you have a strong background in proof-based math.Highlights:- The introduction (Chapters 1-4) is really good and does a good job setting up all the fundamental concepts of algorithms.  I think a lot of people tend to skip over introductions because they think they know all of it already, but this is an introduction that I recommend reading the whole way through.- The book is a pretty light read (none of the math is too difficult) and each chapter is a good length.- I think the material on dynamic programming and greedy algorithms was particularly enlightening, and if you read it the whole way through you actually learn how to prove that greedy algorithms work, instead of just being like ""let's use a greedy algorithm because it seems right""- I was able to copy a lot of CLRS code almost verbatim in my programming interviews and pass them.- The figures are really well done and informative.Drawbacks:- The pseudocode has a lot of one-letter variable names, and while this follows the tradition of pure math, it also makes understanding the algorithms more difficult than it should be.- Sometimes the pseudocode is not the ""easiest"" possible pseudocode (for example, merge sort), and I think it would be better if the authors presented a simpler version of the pseudocode first and then extended it to the optimal version.  But then I guess CLRS would be even longer than it already is.- The arrays are 1-indexed, which makes it trickier to convert to code.  Also there are some sections of the textbook (the counting sort section) where some of the arrays are 0-indexed and other arrays are 1-indexed, which is just weird.- I think the material on graphs, particularly the derivations, could be done in a more engaging and intuitive way.  The derivations in Chapters 22-24 were a long series of small uninteresting lemmas, instead of a small number of harder, more insightful theorems.  I found derivations elsewhere on the internet that were a lot more interesting and built more intuition about why the procedures worked.  I feel like the rest of the book is pretty good though, so maybe all the graph stuff was written by a separate person who is not very good at explaining things.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (The MIT Press)"
"Overall, I think the book is a great resource for learning about algorithms and advanced data structures, and is approachable enough for the persevering self-taught types. I especially appreciated the review of required math found in the back of the book, as the descriptions and lessons are concise and did well to simply refresh my memory.Most people will find their first encounters with algorithms to be challenging, but some people might find the format alone challenging, especially if they haven't taken any logic or discrete math courses.I took a star off because of two specific things:1) I found the physical size of the text to be burdensome. So many times I wished that the book was available as a collection of it's sections, as a set of separate texts. It's a lot to carry for any commuting student, especially when you only need to access to 50-75 pages a week. It's not all bad, though. My left arm got pretty buff from reading this thing on the train.2) A lot of the math is performed within the paragraphs, making it difficult to process as a visually oriented person with terrible working memory. Granted, this type of writing is par for the course when discussing mathematics at higher academic levels, and is to be expected. I still would have paid more money to purchase a version where the mathematics are presented in a direct proof format.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (The MIT Press)"
"This book (colloquially known as CLRS) and 
Algorithm Design
 (known as KT) are the two most popular textbooks on the analysis and design of algorithms. Compared to KT and other algorithm books, CLRS is definitely more mathematical, with a lot of emphasis on proving correctness and time complexity of algorithms. To illustrate, CLRS begins with a simple sorting algorithm (insertion sort) and an introduction to running time analysis, defining big-O, big-omega, theta, little-O, and little-omega notation. For example, if an algorithm is O(n^2), that means that in the long run the algorithm will take an amount of time which is (at most) quadratic in the size of the input. In contrast, KT starts with five problems which are a lot more advanced than sorting, and then goes into running time analysis, but it is not as mathematically involved as CLRS.In general, CLRS focuses less on the algorithms themselves and more on the mathematics behind them. Before going into this book, you'll need to have mastered basic proof techniques (especially induction), and you should be very adroit at manipulating mathematical equations. It also won't hurt to know some combinatorics. At the end there is an appendix with a lot of useful mathematical facts and tips/review on summation techniques, set theory, graph theory, combinatorics, probability, and linear algebra.At over 1200 pages, the book covers a huge amount of material. The only downside is that occasionally the material is not covered very well and/or insufficient examples are given. But overall I recommend this text.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (The MIT Press)"

"This book tackled the subject in a way that appealed to my logic.  Starting by walking through what can be achieved by navigating pre-prepared visualizations, then creating those visualizations and finally getting the underlying data.This meant it was easy to track through the capability of the tool and some of what can be achieved.  It was very clear where the scope of the book ended and when other sources were required.You definitely needed to get the accompanying downloads to make the book make sense and work through the examples step by step.There were a few errors in the scripts - but that became a challenge!  It would have been nice to have a few exercises to achieve what the examples achieved to give practice ahead of the step-by-step guides.Having said that I am happy to recommend this book to people beginning PowerBI.  for information it took me about 8 hours to read completely doing all the exercises.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Microsoft Power BI
"Erica Thompson is a senior fellow at the London School of Economics’ Data Science Institute and a fellow of the London Mathematical Laboratory. She has worked on models relating to COVID-19, public policy, and climate change. She might be the last person you would expect to say, therefore, that “follow the science” can be a fool’s folly.Despite the world’s current worship of data as holding the answer to all questions, data are dumb. They know nothing. They rely on models to add meaningful relationships between them. Said slightly differently, all data exist in context. And no context relating to the reality of the world we live in can ever be completely knowable. It is simply too complex to draw it all together in a definable mathematical form.Which is why she quotes British statistician, George Box, as famously noting that, “All models are wrong.” She notes, “The forecast is a part of a narrative…An engine, not a camera; a co-creator of truth, not a predictor of truth.” “Even if the model is ‘made’ by an artificial intelligence rather than by a human expert, it inherits in a complex way the priorities of those original creators.”That is not to say, however, that we should simply jettison all of the modelers and revert to simple intuition or folklore for guidance in dealing with complex issues like weather, climate change, and pandemics. We just need to use their models responsibly. We need to understand their limitations and potential biases that may be unknowingly built into them.And she concludes the book with five recommendations that should be adopted to help do just that. And they all make sense to me.I live in the world of business, not public policy. And in the 45 years I have toiled in the corporate world I have been alarmed at the degree to which business people today rely on data and the financial models they create with them to make important decisions that greatly impact the lives of real people. Intuition and experience are largely dismissed, which is one of the reasons youth is in and those who have been there before are largely relegated to the back of the room.Virtually no project gets approved today if it is not supported by an elaborate financial model. And if you can say that it was built with Big Data it is almost a shoe-in. Yet are our corporate decisions today any more accurate, or just less considerate of the company’s constituencies, particularly its employees.Common sense is the oldest form of intuition there is and this book is full of it. Wherever you stand on the largest issues of the day, like climate change, this book will help you become more informed and better able to represent your position.And it’s all written in language that any of us can follow. No mathematical notations or dense scientific jargon. The writing is very conversational and easy to follow.Well done.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Escape from Model Land: How Mathematical Models Can Lead Us Astray and What We Can Do About It

It covers an incredible range of important topics, from the fitness for use of a model, to exchangeability, to explainability, to the dangers of a single focus.  I particularly enjoyed two discussions:  the first that “you can’t fight complexity with complexity” and the idea that if you constantly reframe the problem, you delay action.One nit:  While the book hints at the problem of poor data quality, it does not give it the attention it deserves.

"As I was reading through the book I began to wonder when the author was going to stop complaining about mathematical models and present concrete alternative approaches rather than vague hand waving about getting all stakeholder opinions represented. The more I read the more I got the feeling the complaints were constantly recycled to make a full length book of open ended complaints with no concrete achievable solutions suggested. The main complaint was that mathematical models inherently reflect the prejudices, selfishness, and corruption of the model creators. As such they do not address all the realistic concerns associated with the model’s use. The author’s solution was to either entirely jettison mathematical models in favor of a committee of diverse human “experts” navel gazing at what real world data is available to produce a “consensus” of what the data is telling us or the new committee adjusting model outputs based on a consensus of their expertise. My sense is adding more diverse human prejudices, selfishness, and corruption to or replacing mathematical model output would not make for more reliable decisions… just slower ones.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Escape from Model Land: How Mathematical Models Can Lead Us Astray and What We Can Do About It
"This book is well written, reads quickly, and has many fine examples of problems. It blows many whistles appropriately.  It could be a good antidote for those too enamored of their own or others' models. It is a good provocative book for those modelers and thinkiers in the mood for reflection.  It also has suggestions, such as the need for alternative conceptual models reflecting different perspectives. That, in requires being aware of different perspectives.  She also notes the special role of ""performative models"" that may be useful but have big problems.One of her provocative claims is that modeling provides a framework to use, which can be useful even if the framework isn't right. That's an astute observation, although--obviously--a ""bad"" framework can sometimes have very nasty consequences and support dangerous nonsense (e.g.,  astrology.The book's biggest weakness, perhaps, is ascribing too much virtue to human discourse and reasoning that is not explicitly model-based.  It sometimes seems as though she is saying the solution is to have better experts. or more common sense. If only it were so easy. Another problem is a tendency to generalize --focusing on examples of bad practice. She gives little space to practices that can do better. For example, muti-resolution, multi-perspective modeling and broad-reaching exploratory analysis under uncertainty can help.  Making sharp distinctions between using models for description, explanation, postdiction, exploration and prediction is important. Agent-based modeling can represent possible behaviors and heuristics.  Including uncertain qualitative factors can help. More generally, vigorous discussion, review, and debate can help.  She doesn't adequately distinguish between statistical ""modeling"" with the benefit of empirical data and more speculative causal modeling to help in dealing with futures for which appropriate data is often lacking.I would have been happier if her conclusion had been more a call for balance and a description of what kinds of balance researchers might seek.  I would also have welcomed candid recognition that the quality of practitioners matters.

"I had the opportunity browse through this book in my local library before deciding if it was worthwhile acquisition for my library.  After reading the introduction, a random chapter, and the conclusion, it was clear that this book is not worth the paper is printed on.According to the book description, the author is a statistician, but she seems to be more a philosopher or social scientist based on her publication record and the content of this book.  I find shocking her deterministic statements about model outcomes.  She seems convince that if a model makes a predictive outcome with a low probability, they outcome cannot happen, or the model is a poor representation of reality if the outcome occurs.  Both statements are incorrect for the following reasons:(i) A low probability event can occur at random, but it will occur with a low frequency. Let’s say that a mathematical model predicts that there is a 0.01% chance of rain today.  This doesn't mean that it cannot rain today.  In fact, it can, but it will be a rare event. This is basic statistics and random probability. In the book, the author suggests that if the model predicts a low probably of raining today the model is wrong!(ii) A model is a representation of a system under a series of assumptions and a constraint set of initial conditions and parameter values.  Mathematical scientists always use the principles of Occam's razor. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to finish the development and validation of a model. Naively, many individuals – like the author – seems to believe that models are a perfect representation of reality.  No mathematical scientist will every claim that this is the case!Based on my experience, there are scientists who abuse the power of models to impress the public, and gain favors or the respect of politicians.  These scientists probably come forward with the intent to gain power or the attention.  On some occasions, these scientists are simply arrogant, or suffer from confirmation bias. As a result of this, they are unable to acknowledge the limitations of their models.  These are the individuals, who are citizens in Model Land.  The rest of mathematical scientists are developing models, which are making our lives better every day!",1.0 out of 5 stars,Escape from Model Land: How Mathematical Models Can Lead Us Astray and What We Can Do About It
"This book was too painful to finish.  Its writing feels like it is dutifully expanding an outline, slogging along without asides, wit or worked out examples -- the worst sort of lecture.  The content is even more dismal.  Rather than deploying her expertise to explain why some models are better than others and how to separate the insights from the misdirections, the author makes the vacuous claim that each model exists in its own little world of assumptions and purposes, true inside it but with no purchase beyond.  To believe otherwise is to fall into the trap of false objectivity.  This book is for fans of the nouveau solipsism, who will be happy that a real data scientist has confirmed what they already knew.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Escape from Model Land: How Mathematical Models Can Lead Us Astray and What We Can Do About It

"I picked up this book a while ago, then it sat on my self unread. A need came up to improve some data visualizations for work, and I pulled this book down to get some ideas and understand the tools available to me. I wish I had read it earlier, as it give a very nice introduction to visualization in R using the ggplot library.To me, the most important aspect was the introduction to the ideas of Wilkinson and ""The Grammar of Graphics"". It was an eye-opening way to think about processing and presenting data, and will serve me well in the future. The rest of the book is a mostly practical tutorial on different aspects of ggplot.There are a few errors in the book, some attributed to changing libraries, but any book about working in a programming language is going to suffer from these problems. I would also say that the book starts out strong, then becomes more rote as you get deeper in to it.

The use of figures and margin notes give you a sense of being guided through the ideas rather than just being told what they are. I've had lots of fun going back to some of my own visualizations made with R and ggplot2 and improving them based on what I learned here.I absolutely recommend this to beginners and experts alike.

This orientation can be helpful even when the user already knows the syntax (mostly) because it helps create a mental framework that enables more creative use of ggplot2 beyond examples that are provided in the many books available.I recommend the book even if you have other intro books already and even if you already have basic capabilities in using ggplot2.

"My first impression was that this book was short (1). However, I found it a useful introduction and reference to Root Cause Analysis (RCA). It is probably comprehensive at an introductory level. I suspect that a much larger book would have overwhelmed me. I would have preferred many more detailed worked examples, but then it would have become a much larger, different and more expensive book.The book is in two sections. Section I gives an “Introduction to Root Cause Analysis”. Section II is a “Root Cause Analysis Quick Reference”. The chapters in Section II mirror those of Section I; they even have the same or very similar chapter titles. For each tool described you are given an adequate understanding and sometimes a short example. In Section I there are numerous references to other publications listed in the 3 page References section at the back of the book.The topics discussed in the two sections are:The Scientific MethodThe Classic Seven Quality Tools (2)The Seven Management Tools (3)Other Tools (4)Exploratory Data Analysis (5)Customer Quality Issues (6)Why did I buy this book?

"I have used many Excel how-to manuals over the years, and I can say unequivocally that this is the most high-end product available for Excel business modeling. The content in this book is the type of material that you would learn in an Ivy League MBA program (~$100k in tuition) or at a top consulting firm after years experience -- all for the price of a textbook. The pedigree of the author is incredible, both academically and industry-wise, and I truly felt as if I was learning from the preeminent guy in the field. I think the biggest advantage of this book over similar products is that the author uses real-life examples that he has encountered in his decades of consulting experience in industry to teach the reader complex modeling from finance to supply chain to sports analytics. Unlike other material I have used, the author is adept at engaging the reader and making you feel like he is talking directly to you. I am a consultant at one of the most notable firms in the world, and this book has become the secret weapon that differentiates me from my peers.Pros:1. The examples are laid out very well and the author provides files that you can download to follow along with;2. The author does not use boring examples like comparable products, yet real-life problems that the reader can relate to;3. The author has a tremendous pedigree and can be considered an expert in his field;4. The material in this book has made me the premier Excel guy at my organization that everyone comes to in order to solve problems.Cons:1. I feel like the author is someone that knows ""a lot about a lot"" and he tends to hold back on some topics just because his publisher probably imposes a page count limit on him;2. The book is a large soft-back textbook, but it is still very portable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Microsoft Excel Data Analysis and Business Modeling (Business Skills)
"The content is great, you're going to learn a lot from this book. The book is huge which isn't a problem, but something you should note if you're deciding between the print and kindle versions. My main issues are with the format of the book and example problems.First, I find it strange that they don't include a short chapter at the beginning about shortcuts. They probably did this because they didn't want to include both Windows and Mac shortcuts.My recommendation to the author: Include a tear-out shortcut page in the beginning of the book for readers to reference.Second, the example workbooks are inconsistent. All examples include a workbook with the solutions filled in, but only some examples offer a blank workbook for you to fill in yourself. In the cases where there is only the solved workbook available, it is easy enough to clear the cells yourself, but it spoils the fun a bit.However, the main issue is that every example is in a separate workbook. Including a separate workbook for both the solutions and the blank workbooks. When you have 6+ examples per chapter, you have to open a minimum of 11 workbooks per chapter for 89 chapters which seems excessive. If you have the ""Enable Editing"" prompt enabled within Office, you will have to enable editing on each workbook individually which can be a pain.My recommendation to the author: 1 workbook per chapter. Include separate sheets for each example and solution.My recommendation to readers: Disable the ""Enable Editing"" promptFinally, there are some sloppy errors in the wording of some of the examples. For example, in one of the chapters they are talking about doing a 10 year forecast, but halfway through the example they switch from years to months. It's not that big of a deal, but it's this inattention to detail that makes you question the author's credibility.My recommendation to John Pierce: As the editor, you should probably be more attentive if the author is going to name-drop you in the acknowledgments.Even with these problems, I still have no problem recommending this book. If the author fixes these issues, I will gladly give this book 5/5. As it is now, this is a 3 star book.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Microsoft Excel Data Analysis and Business Modeling (Business Skills)

"This book is a broken mess.The sections on theory, for example the discussion on the which graph to use where in chapter 2, are fine.But then, suddenly, you are asked to do activities by yourself which the textbook hasn't prepared you for and you have to resort to the appendices to see how it should be done. Sometimes (e.g. activity 7) examples just doesn't work - the code is completely broken and the book doesn't prepare you for how to resolve it. No amount of googling is able to put you on the right track either. Exercise 23 just ends in a ""type error"" as lambda takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given which, if the forums are to be believed, is because the function is not longer supported by Python. Next your are doing exercises and can follow along the examples in the chapter and all is fine again, but then functionality is introduced which isn't explained and you end up parroting the text. The text makes you install Hadoop, which with the problem solving took me 3 hours, and then moves unceremoniously on to Spark, which with the errors in the text is its own can of worms without ever going into Hadoop at all.This books just comes across as poorly edited and with little to none quality control resulting in frustration.

"Bayesian Artificial Intelligence, Second Edition by Kevin B. Korb and Ann E. Nicholson is among one of the very few books which explain the probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian belief networks in a balanced way; i.e. without making it a mathematical exercise in futility or by dumbing it down too much to make it a `practical guide'. This book is an interesting read and knowing the KDD genre, it's few and far between when one can say these words about a machine learning book.Bayesian Artificial Intelligence is organized into three main sections; probabilistic reasoning, learning causal models and knowledge engineering. The book discusses Bayesian networks as a function of their usage i.e. for reasoning, learning and inference. Book begins with an introduction to Probabilistic Reasoning where authors discusses Bayesian reasoning, reasoning under uncertainty, uncertainty in artificial intelligence,  probability calculus and other related concepts. Authors then provide a primer of Bayesian networks before discussing inference in Bayesian Networks. In the chapter titled applications of Bayesian network, authors elaborate on different types of applications and their practical implementations. In the second part authors focus on learning the causal models, learning the probabilities from datasets, Bayesian Network classifiers, learning linear causal models, learning discrete causal structure and so on. The third section concentrates on knowledge engineering with Bayesian Network; it has a long chapter which talks about different aspects of knowledge engineering for example KEBN life cycle, Bayesian network modeling, how Bayesian structure is build, kept and developed  etc. Finally we see the case studies for different sections and the software packages associated with it.I personally really enjoyed this book mainly because it's to the point, precise and well written. Due to the wide range of the field of machine learning and implementation of Belief networks, it becomes quite challenging to comprehensively cover the area. If you would like to read more about the general graphical models and probabilistic graphical models in machine learning, there are other texts out there however if your focus is Bayesian Artificial Intelligence and the belief networks, this book is quite useful.The book is not written as a typical text book but still provides a set of problems at the end of each chapter. For theorem solvers and theory lovers, there are also various theoretical issues discussed in this book throughout related to the Bayesian provability and probability calculus. Overall it is not a so called `math heavy' or theorem proving text but rather quite practical introduction to Bayesian AI. I highly recommend this book if you would like to learn Bayesian AI, Bayesian belief networks, Bayesian inference, learning, reasoning or any pertaining disciplines.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Artificial Intelligence (Chapman & Hall/CRC Computer Science & Data Analysis Book 2)
"The book by Korb and Nicholson is very readable and structured. Starting with some background information in statistics it comes directly to the major topic of the book - bayesian networks. The theory thereof is nicely evolved and applied to small examples to demonstrate its usage. Each chapter finishes with a short summary and bibliographical notes for further readings.In my opinion this book is well written and the chosen examples are insightful. What I do not like is part three of the book which is devoted to case studies and praktical examples. If this space had been used for the first two parts by providing more details, e.g., for the discussion of path models (which is given but only short), this book could be even great on a more advanced level. In this form it is very good as an introduction in Bayesian Networks and related topics like the larger class of causal models.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Artificial Intelligence (Chapman & Hall/CRC Computer Science & Data Analysis Book 2)

"It is difficult to assess a review without understanding the biases of the reviewer.  I fall under the category of researcher/practitioner when it comes to reasoning with graphical models.  I am familiar with and make use of several books and papers on this topic in my work.  Of the set of standard references (Pearl, Jensen, Neapolitan, Jordan, Cowell et al., Borgelt & Kruse) the text by Korb and Nicholson (K&N) stands out in terms of its clarity and accessibility.  Does the book have everything one would ever want to know about Bayesian inference?  Not by a long shot.  Is it, however, a good place to start?  Definitely.  The basic concepts are presented relatively completely and with clarity.  I consistently recommend K&N over other alternatives to colleagues new to the field.  Is there a chasm separating concept and algorithm in the book?  I don't think there is, especially relative to other references.  With tools such as Kevin Murphy's BNT, or Netica available on the Web, it seems to me that providing a solid conceptual framework becomes paramount for a textbook such as this.  I believe K&N succeed admirably in this sense.  Why four stars and not five?  Even for an introductory text such as K&N, it would be nice to have more development of some concepts such as causality, context specific independence, or loss of independence in dynamic nets.  Although it won't be your last book on reasoning with graphical models, K&N should probably be your first.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Artificial Intelligence (Chapman & Hall/CRC Computer Science & Data Analysis Book 2)

If you ever wanted to delve into this topic but felt intimidated for any reason or you just want a textbook on the topic that cuts out all of the nonsense, I would definitely recommend picking this book up.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills"
I love the style of this book. It is very easy to follow. The qeustions at the end of the chapter are solved in very detail at the appendix part.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills"
"Overall this book has been an enjoyable way to learn data structures and algorithms. The level of detail in most cases is perfect. The examples are diverse and well-explained. The knowledge checks and walkthroughs in each chapter offer enough challenge to test you without being too frustrating. My only critique so far (about half way through) is that the vast majority of examples are in Ruby and it would be nice if some more of the complex examples like linked lists and recursion were also done in Python. Also, the kindle version has some bugs when highlighting, where if you try to highlight some sentences it ends up doing the whole page.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills"
"I was by no means “a beginner” when I picked up this book. But it’s also been 20 years since I learned anything DS&A. I picked this book over others mostly on a whim, but being geared towards beginners, I was at least assured that the subject material would fly over my head.So don’t get me wrong, this is a fantastic, educational book. My complaint is against how the author chose to interject his explanation of the code. My feeling is that he’s taken away part of the book for those like me who don’t need (and can’t stand) highly-commented code. Heck, I’m okay if there were just a few, well-worded, well-placed comments that gave reasons for unclear aspects of the code. But at about a quarter through, I stopped trying to read too much of the code. It just gave me a headache trying to parse code from comments. When it’s all “black and white,” it just blurs together.Then, once you’re done trying to find the code amongst the comments, realize it’s maybe 6 lines of code, he says, “This code is not trivial, so let’s break it down.” Dude. You already did that. In the middle of the code. Using comments. And also. My man. Six lines is very nearly the _exact_ meaning of trivial. Non-trivial is when you need to create classes and use _actual_ programming techniques of architecture and design. Not writing 6 lines of code that you didn’t even write tests for because you’re not the first person to write it that way, in that language.So if you can get past the frustration involved with that aspect, the actual DS&A part is amazingly good and easy to understand. I’ve recommended the book on more than one occasion; I only mention the code comments when I think it’ll benefit the person to whom I’m recommending the book.I would certainly enjoy a second, less beginner-focused version that maybe expands on the concepts, or even repeats some with more succinct code/comments.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills"
"I learned DS&A back 6 years ago in university and so many concepts just went over my head. After reading this book, a lot of the concepts have been dumbed down to the point that the concepts are incredibly easy to understand. Also appreciate the analogies the book references when first introducing a concept. Would recommend if you’ve seen DS&A and it just didn’t make any sense at first. This book is for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills"
Enjoyed reading the book and getting to know fundamentals of data structures and algorithms with it. I'm far enough in my self-taught programming to understand the examples but the switching between languages may be a challenge to newer programmers.  If you're strong with one of the languages used in the book you should find the other languages relatively easy to read though. Definitely a book I'll recommend to my younger coworkers.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills"
"As far as introducing the data structures this book takes a great visual approach. Algorithms are often easiest to understand in animated form but the step by step of this book is quite strong.The major weakness is by jumping between JS, Python, and Ruby you never fully develop any of them. Although the programmatic style is mostly translatable between these three languages it’s still typically better to do one thing fully rather than a few things partially. My feeling is that Ruby was the most represented of the three.All in all worth a read for the visualizations of the structures and algorithms.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills"
"I only got this book because others suggested it. Even though most code is written in python, pearl, and JavaScript the code is readable to the point that you can comprehend the examples and can replicate them using your preferred programming language. For example, I use mostly Kotlin and Java and as long as you understand basic programming syntax, then it’s straightforward.Honestly this book made me not afraid of data structures. I used to avoid studying them, but now I feel like I was worried more because of “big words” instead of the data structures.Thanks for writing this book! It gave me confidence to learn deeper topics. By the way, I think step by step details were so good. Most books force you to assume steps from beginning to end, but you actually show each step. Even though it cost a lot of ink to print each step haha, it is so worth it in terms of visualizing a complex/new concept.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills"

"Brian’s experiences clearly drive this book and it was a very refreshing read.  The successes, ups and downs, lessons learned, how to ask great questions, blind spots to look out for, understanding the why, knowing your numbers, knowing yourself.  These are all relevant at every stage of business growth,  but often these elements can be overlooked and prevent success.I’ve been fortunate to know Brian for over a decade.  I first met him as the turn around guy.  He was the consultant brought in to fix a business with sizable opportunity, however it wasn’t reaching its potential.I’ve seen Brian first hand apply many of the lessons he’s detailed in this book. What he was applying in 2009, he's still applying today and doing so successfully over and over.  I’ve been on the receiving end of him asking about the P&L, the “why are things being done this way”, I’ve seen him analyze an employee cost statement, or a marketing acquisition statement, and find every possible hole as to why a business isn’t performing.  I’ve seen him successfully run a business from afar by literally asking the right questions, putting the right leader in place, and helping that business grow.  I've sat across from him over a drink in Park City analyzing his teams numbers that day and ""knowing his numbers"".  So much of what I've seen Brian successfully apply in the business world is right here in an easy to read book.Brian doesn’t tell you in this book or in real life what you want to hear, he tells you what you need to hear, and then its up to you if you are willing to apply it.  His success isn’t a mistake and I’ve seen his leadership, guidance, and tough love elevate the careers of so many.

I have read many other books like this that could be described as self-help books but I appreciate that this was not just motivational fragments, it got into the nitty-gritty of the money behind actualizing your success (but the motivational quotes included were still valued).One of the things I find most fascinating is the influences that come together to make a seemingly new thing. This applies in so many areas of media creation, but it is something I did not think to apply to people until I read this book. What goes in, must come out.

I really like Dr. Lawson's book based on the direct approach he takes to describing the methods. One particular point I enjoy is that he specifically discusses not only the noncentrality parameters for each effect of interest but the use of them. Other DOE books only hint at these items which leaves the reader with the necessity of deriving the power calculation on their own. The inclusion of R code is especially nice to show the design and analysis of the experiment in the scripting language and also a discussion of how to interpret the results.

"Others have have already said that this book is superb and I completely agree.  If you have had a class that covers applied statistics (basic correlation and regression) you should be able to pick this up and read it with no trouble.  There is math here but is is *well* explained and the algebra is always presented with a worked example.The code at UCLA (sorry they will not let me post the link here) makes the incredibly good writing even more valuable because, not only will you understand the concepts behind Mixed Effects/Hierarchical Linear Models, you will be able to implement the ideas.  If you already have some experience with Mixed Effects/HLM browse the code and you will quickly see this book covers a wide scope.  I have worked with the SAS code a lot and even though the book is a bit old (by a programmer's standards) the code still works just fine.While the book is written to be clear for non-mathemeticians, there are many ""intermediate to advanced"" statistical topics covered here.  These are importantly areas which are typically unintelligible to non-statisticians or are glossed over or ignored by other authors.  Here are some noteworthy examples.  This book could/should be used as a text on data exploration and visualization.  There are many case-studies throughout the book and they all begin with great visualizations (with the all important code supplements showing the novice how to make the plots in the book).  Topics like fitting lines, splines, curves are covered clearly and are shown beautifully.  The discussion on choosing between sets of models using deviance (-2log likelihood) and AIC has the best coverage of any book.  The general discussion of likelihood estimation (maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood) is superb.  The coverage of data transformation for model fitting is explained well and is presented with wonderful plots.

"I have a physics background with a strong interest in ML and think there are a couple of issues with this book. The figures in the first chapter are in the wrong order with wrong labels. Figures use a color scale not suited for a book sold in gray scale. Most chapters only scratch the surface of the topics. Over long stretches, the book lists complete code examples in a if-we-do-this-we-get-this-result style. Training *some* network and measuring its performance can be found in countless online posts. I expected much more insight from experience and interpretation of results. If you are not familiar with finance, you will need to look up a lot of terms, as they are not defined in the book. The chapter on normative finance tries to use mathematical rigor which doesn't add anything to the text.

Recommended for database administrators, developers, and architects working with graph databases.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Graph Data Processing with Cypher: A practical guide to building graph traversal queries using the Cypher syntax on Neo4j
"Wow, I wish this book had been around when I learned Cypher and graph modeling!This book provides a detailed overview of Cypher language structure and features. Its biggest strength is its focus on the data modeling concepts behind the language and how they are best leveraged to drive performance.The author begins with a succinct description of the syntactical elements that comprise the language.  The examples here are well-chosen and illustrate subtle aspects and gotchas.  Next we move to an extended example using synthesized medical data to illustrate more advanced concepts. This example is particularly germane because it is sufficiently complex to show the impact of different modeling/querying approaches while remaining easy to understand for non-domain experts.Effective graph modeling is use-case driven; the best model is determined by the queries it is designed to answer. At the same time, the graph approach allows for a flexible, iterative approach in building a model. By walking through the examples laid out here the reader gets a good feel for how to balance these concerns in practice.Neo4j’s various indexing capabilities are well covered, again with useful examples. These include less well known features like geolocation and text indexes.  The book is copiously illustrated with screen captures showing how the elements of Neo4j work together.  The reader gets a good grasp of the graph database development flow.Other highlights:Analyzing query performance in Neo4j is something of a dark art.  The author lifts the veil by providing comparative examples of queries using Neo4j’s query profiling capabilities.The count store is a relatively less known Neo4j feature.  It is discussed here with good examples of how to leverage it to improve performance.The chapter on APOC does a great job highlighting the most useful functions from this massive library, not shying away from the more complex  functions like expandPathConfig.  At the same time it provides enough general background for the reader to explore other APOC features.The final chapter (Tips & Tricks) is a goldmine of pertinent technical detail and troubleshooting advice culled from the author's extensive field experience.  Particularly interesting are the schematic diagrams illustrating the binary structure of nodes and relationships in Neo4j.One minor quibble:At least in the version I read, the font used for code examples seems quite large- larger than the main text. This makes the code harder to follow because it frequently gets wrapped into the next line.Overall this is a great book which I would recommend to anyone learning about graph databases",5.0 out of 5 stars,Graph Data Processing with Cypher: A practical guide to building graph traversal queries using the Cypher syntax on Neo4j
"I have been working with Cypher and Neo4j for the past seven years since 2015 and have had the pleasure of knowing and working with Ravi Anthapu on a few projects.  In these years what I have realized is that learning to write cypher queries is easy, but learning to write highly performant cypher queries is an art. Anyone can swing a bat and sometimes hit the base-ball, but to become an MVP baseball player one needs to hone their batting skills under the right trainer. Ravi's Graph data processing with Cypher is not just a book on learning how to write cypher, but how one can hone their skills in writing highly performant cypher.There are quite a few books that talk about cypher and how to write cypher. However few deal with the inner complexities of how the query gets executed, what should be done to optimize the query and how one should think differently when it comes to a graph as opposed to a regular Relational database. In the chapter on Filtering, Sorting and aggregations, the author shows how adding labels actually penalizes the query because of the differences in how Graph traversal works as opposed to a regular sql database where adding an index (the equivalent to a label) usually improves the performance. However in Graph traversal he demonstrates with examples on how the number of db hits increase when adding labels to nodes in the query match pattern. In a chapter 9 he specifically focuses on using the Explain and profile parameters to tune the query. He also provides examples on how to use Index hints to tune the performance of the query.Of course the best part of this book apart from writing cypher which he has done a great job, he also illustrates the use of apoc utilities and the path expander routine which is one of the most useful apoc routines to explore the neighborhoods of a node by allowing traversals on select paths.Overall the book is very practical and great not just for the person who is beginning to learn cypher, but also for people who are looking to improve the performance of the cypher queries they have written by following some of the techniques illustrated in this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Graph Data Processing with Cypher: A practical guide to building graph traversal queries using the Cypher syntax on Neo4j
"This book covers a gamut of Cypher concepts - from the installation specifics, basic and advanced usage of the language to an excellent sample data set to try the code. It will be a great resource for the developers and for Neo4j practitioners in general.Some sections / ideas that stood out for me are: path comprehension, when to (and not to) use labels, advanced usage of list expressions, count stores and planner hints, in-depth details on how query planning works internally (explain and profile) and apoc based path finding.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Graph Data Processing with Cypher: A practical guide to building graph traversal queries using the Cypher syntax on Neo4j
This book is a must-have for anyone starting out with Neo4j and the Cypher query language as well as anyone who wants to master some of the more complex concepts.

"Atlas.ti is one of the leading software packages for qualitative data analysis (QDA). The book has been written by a leading expert in QDA and QDA-software with many years of experience, both in terms of theory as well regarding the application of theory in various qualitative research projects using Atlas.ti. As a consequence, the book covers the  features of Atlas.ti comprehensively and introduces them in a step-by-step fashion, but also gives many practical hints and examples how to approach research problems and how to apply the software to them. Although the book was published when the current version 9 of Atlas.ti has not yet been released, the differences between version 8 and 9 are not significant. Due to the wealth of experience and knowledge of the author, this book is - to my knowledge - the best reference and practical guide to Atlas.ti for beginners as well as for already experienced users.

The first chapter starts with “demystifying” Data Science and clarifying the buzzwords that are used which couldn’t be more apt and useful. There are a lot of misconceptions about Data Science and how statistics are used to produce actionable information and Dr Stylianos Kampakis does an excellent job to present all the aspects of Data Science in a clear and understandable way.

Applying these tools to large data sets in a big data world can be problematic.It has been a long time since I had a stats course so the beginning was a bit dry for me but I do agree that it was important.

"I expected more philosophical than the technical aspect of the statistical approach to the subject matter of this book. In certain parts of the text, the argumentation was too technical for me to follow.  Already for more than 60 years, I have defined my worldview as statistical or stochastic. What has it meant in practice? The percentage has been invented in order to avoid writing decimals in quantitative comparison in percentages of things. With the exception that the measured quantities of the things to be compared are less than 10 percent. As a university lecturer of econometrics in my 'Ajksioms' I have stated: You may write observations with the exactitude of three digits, speak with the exactitude of two without decimals and remember with the exactitude of one digit. If I see written information with more than three-digit exactitude, severe doubts about the sense of relativity and understanding of the author of the information arise. With horror do I look at information where percentages over 10 with decimals are presented as the basis of decision-making?This is my constant creed and worldview. No religion is needed even if with interest and appreciation following the philosophical aspects of religions and beliefs. In mind Popper's definition of the limit between science and religion: Science, if the possibility of error is admitted. Religion, if presented without the possibility of error.Starting to read a book titled 'The Art of Statistical Thinking' I expected more of this kind of philosophic argumentation than the technical approach of statistical science. Therefore, a certain degree of disappointment, also in my ability to follow and understand the text.

"I received the book as a gift. This book was incredibly frustrating for a dummies book. The authors throw code at you and do not explain every line ! How can one expect to be able to program by one's self if code is not explained to you when you are learning it.  I understand that the book assumes you have some knowledge of python, however even if you have knowledge of some python, you may not have knowledge of the commands used in data science. If you are NEW TO DATA SCIENCE, IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL IF EVERY LINE OF CODE WAS EXPLAINED TO YOU (or every long line). And if you are new to python you will be almost completely lost in many sections of this book. I have read quite a few Dummies books on programming, computer science, and math, and this is the first book I have read in the Dummies series that presupposes you are advanced in PYTHON but also advanced in DATA SCIENCE. The reason people buy dummies books is because they need to learn the subject INITIALLY. Why can't every line of code be explained??? Especially when the lines are long and complex. I have read R Projects For Dummies (For Dummies by Joseph Schmuller AND IT IS BEAUTIFUL ! THANK GOD FOR THIS AUTHOR. HE EXPLAINS EVERY LINE OF CODE AND WRITES LIKE HE WANTS TO TEACH YOU A SUBJECT THAT YOU ARE NEW OR RELATIVELY NEW IN. John Paul Mueller (Author) AND, Luca Massaron give the impression that they do not want you to learn python as if it should be a carefully guarded secret. Maybe they are afraid that we will compete with their careers if we learn Python???

(the reader may not be familiar with python within the context of data science) Chapter 7 ""CONDITIONING DATA and chapter 8 SHAPING DATA are very important subjects for a data scientist, yet the authors throw huge blocks of code at you without explaining it.

Later, there is a whole chapter about explainability of NLP models, which I am excited to read. I adore NLP insights.Cons:Like cookbooks, most things are blueprints. That’s very useful if you like those kinds of boxy explanations. I personally prefer typical book format, but this works too. I just find it a little distracting.But the book is rare in that it really explains the fundamentals. Many books junp straight to ML, or are only ML. This is good for foundation.

Great book if you are interested in qualitative research and data analysis!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis in Qualitative Research: Theorizing with Abductive Analysis
"The original title: Surprise! Abductive Analysis in Action, conveys the message of this valuable book much better than the rather meaningless title it was eventually given for marketing reasons. After reading their previous book, Abductive analysis, and the announcement of this sequel, I was eagerly awaiting this book, after reading it I can say it was worth waiting for. In their new book, Timmermans and Tavory provide qualitative researchers with guidelines on how to set up and carry out their research in such a way that it also contributes to the development of theories. Their thesis is that an abductive analysis means that you conduct qualitative research in a different way from the very first moment.(p. 4) “The actual work of qualitative research – both finding surprises and making sense of them – is the work of coding, teasing out variation, and constructing theoretical narratives for data excerpts.”(p. 38).The focus of this book is on analyzing the research data in an abductive way. Data Analysis in Qualitative Research provides advice on core practices across the whole qualitative research arc. It is therefore not a recipe book, but rather a book that provides insight into what abductive analysis means in the different phases of qualitative research. Timmermans and Tavory make their proposed working method tangible because their text is interspersed with small and large examples. A summary does not do justice to this rich book. Below I will give an impression of the main argument of this book, based on quotations from key passages.After a short recap of abductive analysis, the different ways in which you can use theory in this analysis are discussed. Theory as map and theory as compass. You need maps to orient yourself on the content of the area you are researching. You need a compass to move around in that area. Timmermans and Tavory argue in favor of delving into the map theory of your research. They are especially annoyed by researchers who do not delve into the available map theory or only a very limited part of it. Unlike grounded theory, they consider it the responsibility of the researcher to thoroughly immerse himself in the available substantive theory. This enables you to track down the surprises - the discrepancies between observations and the prevailing views in the literature. Everything is surprising without delving into the substantive literature. Compass theory can also fail to explain findings from fieldwork. Then another compass is required.“Surprises assume that something in the data doesn’t behave as it should based on what prevailing map of compass theories predict.”(p. 67) “Even before you code your data, you need to ensure that the data you have will provide you not only with possibilities of surprise but with strong evidentiary grounds to develop promising findings.”(p. 68) Timmermans and Tavory distinguish between two types of coding: open coding and focused coding, to which they each devote a whole chapter. Unlike open coding in grounded theory, open coding in abductive analysis gives “initial sense of the theoretical potential of your observations.”(p. 72) Interrogate your data asking who did what, when, where, how and with what consequences.(p. 73) “Surprises need to be teased out of the observations you have now. (..) The trick of open coding is to allow yourself to open your observations in different directions, but to do so with some idea where you are opening a door to.” (p.88-89)“Focused coding means that you settle upon a promising theme and then code within it. (..) Focused coding starts with what you think the case is most likely about, and ends with a close examination of what you actually have.”(p. 92) You construct a “proto-set” an initial set of observations that you will later winnow down. You search for an index case that anchors the analysis you are embarking on.(p. 93). Two very detailed examples show what focused coding looks like in practice. This enables researchers to make the translation to their own qualitative research. Incidentally, it is surprising that in both examples the original research question could so easily be jettisoned. In both cases, the research data seem to determine the research question. This is a strange turn of events, even for a qualitative researcher.Even after open en focused coding you need to hunt for clues of possible surprises.(p. 115) Surprises emerge against a background of theoretical expectations, different hunts, habitats, clues are possible. How can you interrogate your data in a theoretically generative way. Timmermans and Tavory make a plea to use the different kinds of tensions and incongruities in the data as points of reference. As a qualitative researcher you go against the official narrative, you have to be intellectually subversive. Going against the grain produces valuable clues about interesting things just below the surface.(p. 128) Tensions and surprises cannot exist without each other. Tensions force us to stand still in our tracks. A surprise is a narrative turning point. A turning point depends on the ability to stand still for a while. We need the ability to stand still to take a different path. By intersperse their text with small and large examples, Timmermans and Tavory make their proposed working method tangible.In Chapter 8 Writing it down, writing it up, Timmermans and Tavory advocate rhetorical abduction, a detective narrative in which you don't give away the denouement in the introduction, but only at the end. A good place to start for write-up is the index case. The remainder of this chapter provides insight into how the peer review process of a journal article resulted in an additional abductive loop.All in all, this is a very valuable book that equips qualitative researchers to detect surprises in their research and thus contribute to theorizing. It is a book that deserves to be read several times making the intended abductive analysis more and more tangible with each reading.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis in Qualitative Research: Theorizing with Abductive Analysis

"The title of this book made it seem like something that I was looking for to help make a business case within my organisation.

"This is a non-technical book written to motivate business folk (or undergraduates studying business) to create value from data and analytics.To connect the ideas to the real world, and to facilitate the reader in analyzing possibilities applicable to their own organization, the book includes three very short use cases:1) Google TensorFlow (TF) - this example highlights that Google created an analytics tool, TF.  This tool is open-source, and is used by many other organizations, both of which helps improve the tool.  In addition, Google uses the tool in its own operations and gains much value from that.2) The self-driving features in a Tesla - this is presented as a case in which appreciation occurs; that is, the AI system improves with usage.  It is mentioned that ""Tesla is aggregating all of the cars' operational and driving data in the Tesla cloud, where it is running even more driving simulations to continuously train the autonomous FSD Autopilot analytic module."".3) A paper which motivated the writing of the book is included in Chapter 4, and it introduces a use case around Chipotle - with this example, the author goes through a six step process to illustrate application of the ideas in the book, namely:Step 1: Identify a Targeted Business Initiative - e.g. ""increasing same-store sales by 7%""Step 2: Estimate Financial Value of the Business Initiative - across 1410 stores, this would result in $191 million in additional revenue for the companyStep 3: Identify Supporting Business Use Cases - for example, increase store traffic via local events marketing, increase traffic with a customer loyalty program, increase shopping bag revenue, etc.Step 4: Estimate Financial Value of Each Use Case - this reveals a comparison of the value of each of the use casesStep 5: Estimate the Value of the Supporting Data - ""how important is data source #1 to use case #1, how important is data source #2 to use case #1, and so on""Step 6: Identify and Capture Analytics - ""the end result is an Analytic Profile for each Chipotle store that captures the analytic results across all the business use cases"".  Each store has unique characteristics - for example, a store can have a lot of traffic, however, the traffic can be very variable; for example, if the store is near a high school and receives a lot of business on school days at lunch time. An ""Analysis Results"" table is given which includes a score and a variability measure for that score for a variety items, such as ""store traffic"".The book doesn't address details about how Google developed its TF product, nor details about Tesla's Autonomous Driving systems.  Certainly a lot of human technical work and expertise went into those.The last chapter is interesting - Creating a Culture of Innovation Through Empowerment.  The author emphasizes the value of diversity of perspectives.  He also lists 5 ""empowerments"", of which a couple are:1) Empowerment #2 focuses on the importance of the customer and speaking the language of the customer.  ""Design Thinking"" can be used, which ""is a highly iterative yet scalable process that starts by:""Empathizing with the targeted customer's challenge.Defining or framing the customer's challenge.Ideating potential solutions (where all ideas are worthy of consideration).Prototyping different solution options (to validate with the customers in order to learn from the customers).Testing, learning, and refining until you find a workable solution.""2) Empowerment #5:  Embrace critical thinking - this is a good point to express to students, as well as a good reminder for anyone.  There are nine separate parts to that lesson, two of which are ""be skeptical"" and ""consider the source"".The author ends on a positive note, encouraging folks to allow any ""failures"" to ""fuel future successes"".",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Economics of Data, Analytics, and Digital Transformation: The theorems, laws, and empowerments to guide your organization’s digital transformation"
"Full Disclosure: I was given the opportunity to review a copy of this book by Packt publishing. I am a data analyst for a large nonprofit organization and have heavily focused on digital transformation in my department and service area (Training and Professional Development).I was immediately struck by the profound simplicity of the author’s message: “data without analytics is an empty promise.” Too often - especially in the nonprofit sector - organizations hoard data in unorganized stacks of paper and haphazard, unstructured file systems and call themselves “data driven”. Bill Schmarzo quickly disabuses us of that paradigm and encourages organizations to become “value driven, not data driven.”With that phrase, he began preaching to the choir with me and I admit to getting quite distracted about how I could apply the concepts and methods he expounds upon to support my own organization’s digital transformation. I’m roughly a quarter of the way through the text and will post an update once I’ve finished (which may yet be a bit as I am an abhorrently slow reader).PROS:- Lots of graphics. If you love infographics, you’ll probably like this book. It has a lot.- Succinctly condenses a complex topic into manageable bites. I echo the sentiment of another reviewer regarding the author’s attempt at “providing rigor” to an otherwise squishy topic. The author’s digital transformation roadmap (replete with infographics) provides a solid-if-superficial framework upon which to model your own organization’s journey.- Helpful tables to accompany the graphics. For those of you who prefer information in tabular form, the author has you covered.- Thoughtful (if liberal) use of bolding and call-out boxes. The author also does a good job of bolding key terms and concepts.- Thorough review of economic principles and laws. As someone whose last brush with economics was more than two decades ago, I was grateful for the refresher.- Worksheets. The “Homework” sections at the end of each chapter were thought-provoking and practical.CONS:- Noisy graphics. Again, given the complexity of the topic, I can forgive the author for the excessive cognitive load his infographics placed on my brain. However, he would do well to engage someone like Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (author of “Storytelling with Data”) to help him refine his graphics. Not all of his graphics were easy to understand on first glance.- Repeated (and often unnecessary) references to his other texts. As an aspiring author myself, I understand the temptation to plug your own works as often as you can. However, the author’s repeated use of his own catchphrases-cum-book titles quickly went from mildly amusing to markedly annoying.- No specific reference to the nonprofit sector. Perhaps I just haven’t read far enough yet but I’d love to see occasional references/examples (or even a small, dedicated section) to the nonprofit sector as historically, this sector struggles with harnessing the power of analytics and digital transformation.In conclusion, an excellent book so far that I fully expect will become a staple in many business libraries. I have already begun to implement pieces of the author’s digital transformation framework in my own organization and very much look forward to seeing what else the text has to hold.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Economics of Data, Analytics, and Digital Transformation: The theorems, laws, and empowerments to guide your organization’s digital transformation"
"First I was offered a review copy of the book  and this review is based on that. Second, I am a mathematician, economist and behavioral psychologist be training and the author of several books on software development, so I am sympathetic to the challenges of writing a book on a complex topic that can provide authoritative advice to practitioners. I'm also very familiar with the value of a good editor.The whole topic of digital business and how to get from a traditional business model to one driven by data and analytics while retaining the value of human insights and innovation has attracted a lot of attention over the past decade and especially over the past nine months, so an attempt to apply some rigor to the topic is valuable and perhaps overdue. That said, I found the ambitious scope of this book a little tough to swallow. Proposing theorems and stating ""laws"" implies a theoretical foundation to the topics covered that just does not exist. The book does not prove any of the theorems it states or provide evidentiary support for the laws it declares. Case studies and examples are illustrations, not proofs and heuristics and guidelines are not laws.  I found the narrative style (largely first person) difficult -- but that's just my reaction.However, none of this removes, at least for me, the core value of the book: It should be possible to rationally justify investments in data (about many aspects of business); the tools required to analyze data so that the results can drive informed business decisions, both strategic and operational;  and the costs and consequences of digital transformation should be understood and the returns expected should be measured to ensure they are actually achieved.  Doing these things well requires a clear strategic intent, knowledge of a variety of fields and a framework to apply that knowledge consistently and efficiently. While not a perfect articulation of these necessary tools, the book does a competent job of covering all the basics (which are necessarily diverse) and organizing them into a workable framework that most business can gain value from.If you can get past the style (I found it tough, but I did actually got through the whole thing) there's a great deal of value here. I just wish the ambition was toned down to closer to what was actually delivered.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Economics of Data, Analytics, and Digital Transformation: The theorems, laws, and empowerments to guide your organization’s digital transformation"

"Much of what I know about “big data” and analytics I have learned from Tom Davenport and again I express my deep gratitude to him. In addition, I have read several dozen books by other authors on one or more aspects of one or both subjects and have learned much of value from them, also. I now share four convictions based on what I have learned thus far. First, the name of the game is not Big Data. Rather, it is having a sufficient quantity of the right data. Also, even then, enough of the right data is essentially worthless unless and until they guide and inform (a) the right decisions and (b) effective execution of those decisions. Also, all right data are important but some are more valuable than others. Finally, the relevance, importance, vale, and sufficiency of data can change, sometimes significantly.For more than two decades, at least since Tim Berners-Lee devised the concept of a worldwide web, business leaders have been struggling to identify their companies’ information needs and then fill them. These are critically important decisions. In recent years, this process has been facilitated, indeed expedited by various electronic technologies, so that better decisions can be made and then executed much faster than ever before.I agree with Bernard Marr: “The marriage of data and technology is radically changing our world and making it smarter. And business much become smarter too…Today the really successful companies understand where their customers are and, perhaps more importantly, what they are doing and where they are going. They know what is happening as it’s happening and they allow that information to guide their strategy and inform their decision-making. Companies that don’t embrace the SMART revolution will be left behind.” Quite true.Marr introduces this acronym, SMART, for the business model he recommends:S = Start with strategyM = Measure metric s and dataA = Apply analyticsR = Report resultsT = Transform businessHe devotes a separate chapter to each component of the model. “When you approach data (big and small) and analytics from this narrower more focused and practical perspective you can get rid of the stress and confusion surrounding Big Data, reap the considerable rewards, and ‘Transform your business.'”These are among the dozens of passages of greatest interest and value to me, also listed to suggest the scope of Marr’s coverage:o Data collection (Pages 12-17, 57-58, and 85-88)o Focus to reap rewards (19-22)o Strategy (23-55)o The SMART Strategy Board (29-33)o The pear tree metaphor (33-35)o SMART questions (43-46 and 52-59)o Project Oxygen (Google): A mini-case study (48-54)o Measurement (57-103)o Datification (64-79)o Analytics (105-154)o Transparency (143-149)o Reporting (155-198)o Data visualization (156-178, 163-269, and 185-190)o Transformation (199-230)It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of asking not only smart questions but the right smart questions. Only then can the right answers, the correct answers, be determined. In this context, I am reminded of Peter Drucker’s observation, “There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.”Once again, I agree with Bernard Marr: “SMART business is a solution that encourages us all to step back from the hype and noise around data – especially Big Data – and take stock of where we are, where we are trying to get to and what data and tools we can employ to get there…One thing is for sure, Big Data and analytics are here to stay and it’s only going to get more sophisticated. We need to embrace it, operate it effectively, deliver value in exchange for the data and apply its significant benefits for the betterment of our world.”Business leaders who are determined to help their organizations use smart big data analytics and metrics to make better decisions and improve performance will find in this volume almost all that they need to pursue that immensely important strategic objective.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Big Data in Practice: How 45 Successful Companies Used Big Data Analytics to Deliver Extraordinary Results

"If you want to start learning R, there several things you may want to consider. There are two kind of skills you want to cultivate: programming skills and actual data analysis ones. In principle, you can learn techniques alone, but then your creativity as a data analyst will be limited and probably you will end up writing poor code. Alternatively focusing only on coding may make you a good programmer, but it will be hard to get started on putting your skill into practice. Any book should strike a tradeoff in where to stand between training you in these two topics. Cotton's book try its best in this and does a pretty good job. The first part of the book, covering the intricacies of the language is the one I found most useful. I has all sort of good advise and explanations on the data structures and functions you can use. It is appropriately applied - not just about computation and programming, but actually links how they are applied in the actual data analysis. In this sense, this was the most original and interesting part of the book.  The second part of the book, covering data analysis techniques was more conventional but still  good. As such, there are perhaps better books if you are interested on any of the two sides (""machine learning for hackers"" is very good to learn how to apply the techniques and seeing them in action; ""Introduction to statistical learning"" is a bit more theoretical; Advanced R or The Art of R Computing are unbeatable about teaching the language, although a bit dray).The approach of Cotton is really instructive. He is friendly, he write well in a easygoing fashion and the book is full of useful tips that helped me to understand how the language merge with the technique.The book is not encyclopedic, it does not cover every single topic (there are better books for that, Matloff and Wickhams books are better). Instead, it does a really good job as a tutorial that walks you through many topics that are somehow not covered in many other books -the chapter that covers factors and dates is perhaps not something you will deal with everyday, but very useful if you have to.Overall, I think the book teaches you really well how to play with the R language.A very final remark. I've seen other comments that suggest this is an introductory book. The book hardly takes things from scratch. If you have never written a line of code, you are likely to find it, particularly the first part, pretty dry. It is more an intermediate text, otherwise you will find yourself wondering why you need to know all these pages about data structures if you just want to learn to load a csv file and run a regression.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learning R: A Step-by-Step Function Guide to Data Analysis

"Mesh advances the analytics domain in ways I'd not considered, but should have. My career has been in technology in small-cap public companies, and historically I've embraced the notion of a centralized analytics team creating and supporting: data pipelines, ELT/ETL, data lake, data marts, etc. Mesh blows up this mental model in favor of decentralized data elements surfaced via API's, and closer to their domain ownership.Dehghani posits a product model for analytic data, where functional teams surface data from operational systems, microservices, etc. directly. No longer reliant on a central team to provide a single source of truth; Rather, they expose data in a more raw form (my words), servicing both their own domain as well as others through defined data ports. She suggests leveraging developers for this work, avoiding the challenge of attracting and retaining resources in the analytics domain (data architects, etc.). Dehghani uses examples from a fictitious streaming music service that seems to mirror Spotify.There's certainly much more, and I recommend Data Mesh to anyone in a technology role. While I applaud her vision, and agree, directionally, with Mesh, there are three areas that I struggled with.First, the Mesh model seems much better suited to a larger tech company such as an Apple, Amazon, Spotify, etc. In my experience, SMB's just don't have the budget/headcount to support the expansive vision that Mesh espouses.Second, Mesh leans heavily toward ""states rights"" and away from central control. The success of this model hinges on knowledgeable, talented technical resources willingly collaborating for a greater good. That, in turn, presumes the existence/extension of global standards, the right culture of adherence to standards, adequate resources to serve the greater good (supporting deprecated API's for the benefit of other domains, for example), etc. In my experience, when the going gets tough, functions/domains tend to become more self-serving.Third, the vision of Mesh is fantastic, and fantastically broad. With data governance and privacy controlled through code. Consistent documentation, both human and computer, available for all data objects. Eschewing data lakes, warehouses, marts in favor of joins across domain API's (again, my words). Although Dehghani seeks to avoid monolithic solutions, I had to wonder if that isn't exactly where a fully-realized Mesh infrastructure ends up.Data Mesh is a bit redundant in pushing its vision for decentralization. It reads very much like a graduate software engineering text, with many references (many are excellent). Overall, very well written and a compelling vision that aligns perfectly with a microservices strategy, digital transformation and a product focus. Although it would be counter to Dehghani's specific vision of avoiding monolithic solutions, I have to wonder if a younger analytics company like Snowflake will try to run with it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mesh: Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale
"TL;DR: a book of ideas, not solutions.If you are looking for a resource to explain what Data Mesh is, its core principles, origin, main advantages, pitfalls, etc., then this book has you covered.If you are looking for a ""playbook"" for how to implement it. Look elsewhere.It is a very prescient work in the sense that the author deeply understands data, and the problems of working with data that originate from modern centralized structures (a.k.a. the ""modern data stack"" - lakes, warehouses, etc.). She prescribes a methodology for affronting this issues through strategy, organizational changes, and forward thinking architectures.Part I tells you what Data Mesh is and the underlying principles. Part II tells you the ""why"" of Data Mesh. Parts III & IV tell you how to design the various components, and part V tells you how to get started.The concept of ""data as a product"" is very compelling, and this section is extremely well done. I had first gotten a glimpse of crude data products when studying Snowflake's Marketplace, which is in essence a catalog of datasets with a basic implementation of the SLOs (service-level objectives) and sharing features as prescribed by Zhamak Dehghani in this book.The reason for the low rating has to do with the fact that beyond explaining what it is, and why we should care, there's hardly anything more of value for the interested reader.It is far, far too high-level, and too theoretical to be of any use to somebody looking for a way to start. Some sections are downright philosophical. The author is aware of this and mentions it toward the end of the book.What if I told you, ""How do you design a car? Well, it should provide a means of locomotion through some sort of engine that propels it forward while providing affordances for the driver to steer this machine through a decentralized mesh of pavement that connects highly populated nodes of human folk - it must be usable, understandable, and have value of its own... The ignition, combustion, materials, stopping, engineering and other considerations are beyond the scope of this book.""Not quite as bad as this, but I'm not over exaggerating either.It gets very terse and repetitive as well. You will read entire re-worded paragraphs from previous sections over and over. Honestly, I kinda loved the book but each consecutive chapter reinforced my view that it needed a more exacting editor.I would say that anyone working with data should read chapters 1-5 (Part I) and maybe Part II as well, since it presents a clear picture of the problems with the modern data stack. Parts III, IV, and V are unlovable.I would perhaps end by saying that it feels like this is a text that is ahead of its time, as the implementation of these ideas are still beyond the reach of most with the technology and organizational structures of today (unless you are Spotify, Google, etc...)Still, a must read if you want to know where the industry is going and where it should be.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mesh: Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale
"This book is the missing manual. If you're in any data driven organization &/or managing an organization through a transformation with the goal to manage distributed data as products, this is a must read.The book is technology agnostic. What it does very well is lay out a very thorough map for what shape data, technologies & teams should look like, what functions they should fulfill & how they should all interoperate as a system to manage data as product successfully. It provides a somewhat idealized vision, but I'm all in as I've seen some of this in action & helped put some of these systems in place.At MarkLogic we helped organizations implement solutions that managed data as product. (I no longer work at MarkLogic & have nothing to gain here in promoting them, just sharing my experience.) MarkLogic integrated data from various silos within large organizations to create data products. Above the silos of data were silos of people that also required integrating. Change management was always a challenge. I recommend How Stella Saved the Farm & The Phoenix Project to help others start to understand the types of changes they need to embrace to succeed. But what was missing was the architectural guide. We made up for it with slides, white papers & tribal knowledge, but this Data Mesh book truly captures some of the best practices I saw organziations put into place.It's all here: start with the business goal and work your way back, data product as self-contained unit, the sidecar pattern, embedding policy as code, start small & fast for a big win, iterate, progressively enhance products, govern with provenance & lineage, the changing roles that support this endeavor, operational & analytical systems & the desired intertwingling, + more..We didn't use the term Data Mesh & didn't do everything captured here. The challenge with any vendor is we tend to think of ourselves as the center of the universe. MarkLogic's way to integrate with a larger world of data was Semantics. But #DataMesh provides a higher level of abstraction.The book's just really well done. Technology vendors don't know how to document like this. Vendors focus on their own product's knobs & levers. What they fail to understand & illustrate for their customers is that their particular technology works within a system of technologies to achieve a business goal. It never works alone. So I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book. If you can grok the patterns outlined here, you can fill in the gaps with the technology, people & process right for your solution.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mesh: Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale
"Zhamak Dehghani says “Data mesh is what comes after an inflection point, shifting our approach, attitude, and technology toward data. Mathematically, an inflection point is a magic moment at which a curve stops bending one way and starts curving in the other direction. It’s a point that the old picture dissolves, giving way to a new one.” Data Mesh, Chapter 6“A strategic inflection point is a time in the life of a business when its fundamentals are about to change. That change can mean an opportunity to rise to new heights. But it may just as likely signal the beginning of the end. — Andrew S. Grove” Data Mesh, Chapter 6In the Data Mesh book, Zhamak Dehghani does not refer only to the real world practices that reinforce the data mesh theory, but also stands on the generally accepted principles of Systems Thinking. Zhamak Dehghani referred to “Thinking in Systems” for Donnelly H. Meadows while talking about leverage points and feedback loops for maintaining Dynamic Equilibrium.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mesh: Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale

If I could offer a criticism, I would ask to her to use language that is plain to the average data professional. However, it is digestible, especially if you take 3 or 4 chapters at a time.

"First of all, I give a 5-star rating on this book, as it is truly an excellent book for those who consider whether to become a quant. This is one of the major objectives the author had for writing this book, so he has clearly done a huge favor to all of us non-quant's, and we should be all thankful for his generous offering of his own valuable experience and knowledge as a domain subject expert in the field, based on his successful career as a quant.For the technical contents, I actually disagree with those other fellow readers who gave a 1-star or 2-star rating. We need to set expectation right that we should not expect that with a book of $20 to $40, we can immediately learn everything about how to build a quantitative trading system to start making money immediately. Instead, we should expect how much this book has added to everyone's existing knowledge base in this field. To me, it's quite significant. I have been following the models and strategies as introduced in

I used to be a physicist long time ago as well, with tons of math learnt and research work done, but jumped to computers two decades ago. One thing that this book helped me settle with myself is that I do not regret that I did not pursue a quant career long time ago, as this book helped convince me that complicated, advanced math doesn't seem to work well with the turbulent markets. In this regard, Warren Buffett remains the best (and maybe one of the few) example of how one can deal with the turbulent markets masterfully  and CONSISTENTLY.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Portfolio Management: The Art and Science of Statistical Arbitrage

Great book to learn more about investing,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Portfolio Management: The Art and Science of Statistical Arbitrage
The contents of this book are too superficial to be useful. Any quant with a passing familiarity of ml in finance is aware of the techniques covered. Nothing new is said nor is it said in an interesting manner. The author clearly knows the material and is a position to offer some real insights but sadly does not do so. I’m still scratching my head trying to figure out who the target audience is. The book implicitly assumes the reader is familiar with the area but then never delves deeper than that familiarity. With a $45 price tag this book cannot be considered a good value. I’d suggest those interested in this topic to spend their time and money elsewhere.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Portfolio Management: The Art and Science of Statistical Arbitrage
"I wanted to like this book. The author has spent several years at SAC (now p72) and Caxton, two first-tier hedge funds. Although neither fund is renowned for their quantitative strategies, this gives Isichenko infinitely more credibility than someone who has learned their trade at institutional asset managers or some minor bank.  And indeed, the book is competent and coherent. Compared, for example, to De Prado's "" 'Advances' in Financial Machine Learning"", you understand what is going on, and the sweeping pronouncements are reduced to a minimum. Some are still there, and I could quibble with them, but that would be focusing on the detail. Let's consider instead the main features of the book. The first three chapters focus on data and forecasting returns. In less than 150 pages, you are treated to linear regression, ensemble methods, model selection, deep learning. I have a basic criticism here. A bit like in the Halperin-Dixon-Bilokon book, this is a compendium of stuff that you could find covered much better in other books. To its merit, this book is shorter and more insightful than the HDB, which was both long, unoriginal and totally detached from finance. Still, you (the reader) will be much better off reading any of: a few chapters of Friedman-Hastie-Tibshirani, the two ""All of Statistics"" by Larry Wasserman or the monumental opus by Kevin Murphy (2nd edition coming! in two volumes). You could argue that it's too much. But these three chapters in Isichenko's book are definitely too little. You won't understand deeply, and if you implement the techniques, you have to study them from scratch anyway. Although (to repeat!) this is better than De Prado, Halperin and other books, I find the little that is finance-specific very superficial and inadequate. The section on covariance cleaning is stuck to Marchenko-Pastur (there is a huge literature on asymptotics of spiked covariance matrices in the past 20 years), and is oblivious to its problems in applications. It is admirable that at least the author talks about signal and portfolio combination; less so that the content is not great. The rest of the book covers finance-specific topics: risk and portfolio construction. But, every topic is treated so superficially to the point of being really useless. Factor models; market impact; performance attribution; the Kelly criterion: all these are ""covered"" at a level that you would receive from reading a survey presentation from Barra or a bank report. Great! Superficiality does not pay off. For example, a lot of signals that work in statistical arbitrage could be described in 3 lines each. *That is not where the value is*. Anyone who has actually worked and implemented factor models or market impact models will tell you it's the experience in implementing these models, and the lessons learned, that really matter.So, three stars. It's a nice pamphlet: it's short, it's clear, but it's awfully generic and superficial as well. As the ""unlikely result of some 20 years of trial-and-error discovery"", as the author writes, it seems a rather disappointing outcome, but I'll leave the final judgement to the author and its readers.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Portfolio Management: The Art and Science of Statistical Arbitrage

"E-book review. This book fully meets the needs of its target audience: analysts and researcher with a course of two of statistics who are new to IBM SPSS Statistics and will be using it for data analysis and statistical work.

Strong points include the detailed coverage of the most important and the most commonly used features of SPSS, the presentation of both the menu system and command syntax for most operations and analyses, the very clear explanations of operations, the insightful interpretations of results from a variety of statistical analyses, and use of multiple datasets. The authors’ extensive experience in SPSS training and consulting pays dividends in their choices of tips and topics to emphasize, which efficiently passes, directly to the reader, knowledge usually gained through painful experience. There are a few minor instances of inconsistent usage (e.g., Output Window versus Viewer) and slight production blemishes (a reference or so to figure numbers which don’t appear in the e-book), but they do not take away from the substantial value of this work.

I had a reasonable understanding of statistics from graduate school courses, but no understanding of real-life data analysis challenges, particularly involving the less-than-perfect data that is usually available. Data Analysis with IBM SPSS Statistics does an excellent job of guiding the reader through this.  One learns how to use SPSS to solve data problems, and there are many tips on multiple ways to approach a problem, and how to pick the best solution for the data and the planned analysis.The emphasis the authors place on showing the reader all the ways in which SPSS can help with the complex task of data preparation is one of the best features of this book.  This is an aspect of data analysis that many inexperienced analysts underestimate, and the authors not only show the reader what SPSS can do for an analyst, but why it is so important. Tips throughout point out some especially helpful features, and warn analysts about some common pitfalls.The chapters discussing SPSS statistical techniques are equally helpful and thorough.  Again, there is emphasis on evaluating one’s data to make sure it is suitable for a given technique, and the data adequacy tests that are presented are explained in detail.

It helps the reader use Kaggle as a stepping stone toward an AI/ML-related profession, such as data science or ML engineering.It starts with the history of Kaggle before it spends most of the remaining pages talking about all respects of a competition. There are chapters on organizing data; using the Kaggle notebook environment; using their discussion forums; the various tasks and metrics seen in a competition; validating, modeling, and optimizing your models; bringing together different solutions for the best results; and specific advice for both computer vision, natural language processing, and optimization tasks. The book ends with chapters on building a portfolio both within and without Kaggle as well as finding professional work.If you're interested in Kaggle or machine learning, this is a great book to get you started.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Book: Data analysis and machine learning for competitive data science
"I've read this cover to cover and I think it's a great book, and it's worth a read. Winning something on Kaggle is notoriously difficult (especially these days), but this book offers a glimpse into the minds of Kaggle Grandmasters. Is there a secret sauce? Not really. It's just a lot of hard work. What particularly I liked about this book? I really liked chapters on hyperparameters tuning, chapter on ensembling, tabular chapter is pretty good, and I liked data augmentation for NLP (it's rare!).

"I found that the book is beyond even a very comprehensive overview for Kaggle competitions. The Kaggle Book indeed shows how to register, setting up your notebook, submit your results, perform data exploration, use evaluation functions, build your models or ensembles, etc. Anything you need to start and win a competition.However, the example code and and the interviews with Kaggle Grand Masters provides a lot of insights in how to actually think and work as a data scientist. It offers an extensive template in how to perform real life data science projects! I did a few Kaggle competitions and work on real life projects as a data scientist, in both areas I found in the book solutions, which myself and my team had overlooked and will remedy immediately...the real life projects and implementations that is! But surely we will do better the next competition on Kaggle as well.This book is a must read and on to have on your bookshelf. Even if you are not planning to do a Kaggle competition. Although I recommend every data scientist to do at least one Kaggle competition and preferably outside your comfort zone or field of expertise. And yes, you will need this book!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Book: Data analysis and machine learning for competitive data science
"This is the first book that I've come across that is singularly focused on the rules, format, tips, and best practices for Kaggle ML/Data Science competitions. As such, this book is well-deserving of your dollars and attention.Before even delving into specific aspects of Machine Learning, the authors chose to spend a great deal of time (chapters 1-5) outlining the basics of Kaggle competitions from the history of the platform, to teams, datasets, notebooks, discussion forums, etiquette, and the different types of competitions available on the site. Complete beginners to Kaggle would get the most use of these chapters, it sure beats trying to figure all of this stuff out on your own.The remaining chapters start getting increasingly advanced in terms of subjects and techniques. I definitely appreciate the authors discussing the importance of the design of good model validation before delving deeper into hyperparameter tuning, walk before you run!The later chapters really drill into more advanced techniques such as using hyperparameter studies and Bayesian optimization to extract the best combination of values for your specific model. Ensembling and stacking are presented as clearly as I've seen anywhere, along with the most helpful snippets of code to date on a ML book. This alone might be worth the price for some. Intermediate and advanced users will get the most of these chapters.A nice extra is the Q&A sections in each chapter with ""Kaggle Masters"", people who have either won competitions in the past or who regularly place very high in many competitions. These are done informally and provide a lot of great tips.Now, who is this book really for? If you are new to Machine Learning, I'd say that perhaps this would not be the best place to start. While the book is great for what it sets out to do (teach you to become a better competitor) it is not perfect.Some information that could be helpful to beginners is grossly glossed over, such as the explanation of specific hyperparams. It is very odd how they chose to handle this. Case-and-point: when going over XGBoost hyperparams such as ""n_estimators"", they describe it as ""usually an integer ranging from 10 to 5,000"". Compare this with Corey Wade's explanation(""Gradient Boosting with XGBoost and SciKit Learn"", also from Packt ), ""The number of trees in the ensemble/the number of trees trained on the residuals after each boosting round. Increasing might improve accuracy on larger datasets"". Which is more useful you think? You either explain it clearly for the benefit of all or just leave it out. Giving the domain and range is not a proper substitution. Obviously, the author's expect the reader to have had some exposure to algorithms and modeling as the pace of several sections move a little too quickly for the complete beginner. As such, I would say this is a perfect book for semi-intermediate to advanced users looking to extract the most out of their models.All in all, this is an excellent resource that will be sure to help countless current and aspiring data scientists in their journeys to become masters of their crafts. I wish I had access to this text five years ago...Highly Recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Book: Data analysis and machine learning for competitive data science
"Kaggle is the most famous data science competition platform. Personally I started Kaggle around 2017 and since that I have learnt a lot of machine learning techniques through participating the competitions on Kaggle. As a student at that time, the biggest challenge for students learning machine learning algorithms is there is no good way to get your hand dirty: it is very difficult to get real-world dataset and work on a real world machine learning problem. Kaggle closed this gap by introducing a data science competition hosted by industry leaders with real world dataset.However, during the process, I always get the question of how to start Kaggle from scratch from my friends or classmates who also want to join Kaggle and learn something. I really hope at that time I have a book like ""The Kaggle Book"". This book introduced how Kaggle competition looks like, and also how to use tools like dataset, notebook, forum to onboard of all the cool stuff Kaggle has. In the second part of book, it introduced some common ML and data mining technique that used by almost everyone in Kaggle. With those techniques and some experiments, it is not hard to start lock a front position on the leaderboard. In the third part, the author also introduces how we can use kaggle to find new career opportunities. As I mentioned before many people came to Kaggle without a ML career background. Kaggle provide a place for people with passions for ML to connect with people from industry and this potentially can change many people's career path.I think if you want to start doing competitions on Kaggle then this is the first book you should check. Meanwhile I also hope the author can continue to publish new books about Kaggle with more advanced techniques.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Book: Data analysis and machine learning for competitive data science
"I've really enjoyed the examples in this book. Well thought-out and they resonate with me. The legos piece for conditional probability was good, but a really great example of a problem is Han going through the asteroid field. A lot of us math people have seen Star Wars and we get this easily.I only wish more care was given to the problem set. I've seen the language is kind of muddy in some of the problems, and an earlier error, but I'm in chapter 16 solving problem 2 and the author not only mistakes the solution by using a wrong probability, but even in the solution writes full paragraphs of explanation that incorporate this incorrect result (i.e. not a simple math mistake). The actual answer is closer to 7.5 than 1.53, because you're using 0.83 (Schwan) and not 0.63 (earwax imp.) in calculating your P(D|H2).Anyway, great book, but if you are careful you will spot errors.

"I read this book and it walks through things in a fun and entertaining and very relatable manner.  If you are new to Bayes (like I am), I would recommend writing out the definitions and keeping a journal, it makes it very easy to go back and review Beta, and some of the definitions of priors when you get to the C3PO chapter.  I found myself rewriting out some of the prior chapters info as new concepts were added. This is not the kind of book you want to read without working some of the math along the way.  I would say if you have a command of some of the beginning  concepts in high school algebra or took stat (even better), you will be fine understanding the concepts.Artwork was beautiful, concepts were fun to read and kept my interest.

"The focus of my professional work is the development and analysis of trading systems.  My constant challenge is understanding, monitoring, and measuring the relationships between the model, the data it processes, the target it predicts, and the results it produces.Managing trading systems requires comparing real-time results with benchmarks, estimating risks, and adjusting position size.  Being able to estimate confidence intervals is critically important.  Bayesian analysis is the primary technique I use.Mr. Kurt clearly explains  how individual data values form distributions, and how the shape and metrics of the distributions change as new data is observed.  He outlines the theory underlying Bayesian analysis, carefully identifying each of the components and explaining how each is determined.  He describes calculation of credible intervals of confidence for means, and probabilities that the means of distributions are different.  The descriptions of techniques are clear and presented with a minimal amount of math.This book is an excellent introduction to the techniques used in modeling and managing trading systems.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way: Understanding Statistics and Probability with Star Wars, LEGO, and Rubber Ducks"
"I purchased this book as an easy-to-read introduction to learn Bayesian statistics for scientific data analysis. The text is fluid, and the book doesn't get too wordy given its mathematical content. I would recommend this book for first time students in statistics or people stepping into data science.One of the things I dislike about mathematics/statistics textbooks is the jargon and the ambiguous symbols, which this books does an excellent job of avoiding. Be warned though, this book is about a technical subject, and there are a lot of mathematical equations, which thankfully are walked through in the text.The author uses a lot of intuitive examples to illustrate the mathematics. However, the book is rather brief, and so this book is better at accompanying, rather than replacing, statistics textbooks.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way: Understanding Statistics and Probability with Star Wars, LEGO, and Rubber Ducks"
"The book was able to provide a clear and down-to-earth explanation of priors and likelihood using a single/Bernoulli parameter.  Before reading this book, I had a hard time differentiating priors from likelihood/data.  I always thought that the data from observations, quasi-experiments and simulation was all I had in working with the numbers; it never occurred to me that bringing in seasoned or experienced judgment through priors could formally and mathematically improve the probability of whatever I was estimating.  Now, I understand why the frequentist and the Bayesian views clash.  It was illuminating to have the tools to counter observations and data when you have other evidence to help in calibrating the final probability or posterior.

"Why do you analyze data? Why do you run a regression? Why do you build a model?Is it to make better predictions under the assumption that the future will be the same as the past, or is it to understand the causes of current phenomena (whether the data source is experiments or observations) and answer what-if (business) questions? If your intellectual curiosity pushes your mind more toward the second question, this is the book that you will thank yourself for deciding to read.On top of that, do you want to see how to apply a causal-behavioral framework to a business question? Sometimes, don't you wish there was a way not to overlay that famous normal distribution data assumption onto your work but to use your data as it is? What about learning a solution when your testing unit and test executable unit are different? And wouldn't it be cool to get a clear roadmap to locate experiments (tests) in the journey of causal inference combined with a behavioral analytics approach? The list of useful information and ideas you can get from this book can go on and on, and these are just a few examples.You will find that the author did an excellent job of presenting not-easily understandable concepts in a reader-friendly way.

"This book is a fantastic resource for those in the field who are interested in causation and robust data analysis. Speaking as a Sr. Data Scientist, I found nearly every page of this book both approachable and relevant. I've recommended it to virtually everyone on my team and in some sense I think it should be required reading for the role.Regarding the delivery of the content, Buisson strikes a healthy balance between rigor and accessibility that I think will cater to a large audience in the field. There is some math but it's not a textbook and the intuition is always clear. Regarding the content itself I almost cannot speak highly enough. In terms of causal inference, many books cover DAGs, chains, colliders, the backdoor criterion etc. but few provide a sensible framework for how to actually go about constructing these DAGs in a given context. Buisson does just this and the end result feels highly tractable (in lieu of some gigantic DAG where there is a cause to everything). Other chapters that I found highly relevant covered bootstrapping, all things experiments, moderation (interaction) and mediation (instrumental variables). All of which I have already found helpful in my actual day to day as data scientist.There are many topics this book does not cover, so do not go in thinking this is a one stop shop. But perhaps the best feature of this book is the content that Buisson does cover that appears absent in so many others. Buisson is an applied scientist and this experience shines through brightly. If you are in the field and you're not just building black box models (cool if you are but you'll know if this is not you) then you might just love this book.Books to pair this with: Anything by Angrist and Pischke.

"This is a killer book for the Python and data wrangling professional, making all other books look like elementary school treatments.  I've read 7 Pandas books and 32 Python books that have Pandas sections.  Stepanie Molin's is by far the strongest, most detailed, easiest to follow, best-exampled book, and easiest to understand of any of the 39 books read.  All other books pale in comparison to this must-read book from Molin.The datasets are intuitive.  Not a boring texty book.  Instead, lots of example code appears on every single page, illustrating the features.  The story and example code flow together, not skipping around or showing disjointed points.  The chapters follow your workflow, from data ingest and EDA to data cleaning, data wrangling, visualizataion, and finally to applications.Thorough treatments are given to data cleaning, data wrangling, and data enrichment as separate topics, going into deep details on how to reshape and reindex data frames, how to do proper joins on data frames, left, right, inner, and outer, and how to do many other data cleaning and wrangling steps.  For exaple, you'll learn how to set a new index, and why you should do that.  And when inserting rows from different dataframes, you can leave yourself a new indicator column that shows you which table added the row.  Pandas has many features like this that professionals should know, and Stephanie Molin shows the ""how to"".Of course there's a GitHub link so you can download the example datasets.  Honestly, I'm only up through data wrangling - have not even reached the financial analysis, machine learning, and advanced visualization code.  I can hardly wait to work all the examples in person.  (As  you know, reading is good, but building the code is by far the most effective way to learn.)Thanks Stephanie for devoting the time to making this a wonderful detailed and usable guide on how to use Pandas to solve my customer's problems.

"With data-driven decision making and business intelligence being an important part of my job, I decided to learn Excel in addition to more recent tools we are using in school. The strength of this book is that it focuses on one aspect of Excel which keeps the size down to a minimum. The only weakness is black and white screenshots, which is becoming more prevalent in visualization books, which is why I didn't deduct a star.Wiley has some of the best content and this title doesn't disappoint (which is why I rated it 5 stars). This was the 2nd book on Excel I have purchased. The first one, MOS Study Guide for Microsoft Excel Exam MO-200, gave me the basics of Excel also in a reasonable size book with downloadable files to practice with.

"I had purchased a new physical copy of the book, and realized there were several pages that were blank and missing. I contacted O'Reilly about the problem and they were extremely quick with a resolution! They were able to give me a different copy so I could read it without the missing pages. The content of the book itself is good, except in all black and white, which doesn't bother me personally but may bother someone else when it comes to the graphs. I think the R and Python content are both great, and it keeps the code concise and quick to the point. Great for R beginners, but for python users I would recommend a little more experience. As for the math parts, its great for those who are new to statistics and gives easy to read explanations, and a great refresher for those who just want to review some of the concepts.

"This has been a common refrain in my review of O'Reilly books. Their technical content is, as usual, excellent and comprehensive. The quality of the printed version is horrendous. The illustrations which were created in color are printed in black and white. As a result, the illustrations are confusing and look faded and would be better off omitted entirely. The printing wanders in and out like it was done on some old dot matrix printer, and the paper seems to be of cheap quality.  Quite frankly, it looks like an international version which is usually printed cheaply so that foreign students can afford it.I'd get a subscription to what was once called Safari Online and read these books online and in color.  I'd stay away from  printed O'Reilly books unless you can verify that the printing is in color and is a quality job overall.

"The authors provide a really nice, non-technical survey of the landscape for Cox Proportional Hazards models. A nice aspect of their treatment is the care they take to reference all highly technical texts and journal articles. For example, if you'd like to find out more about goodness-of-fit tests for survival models, the authors provide ample references to the Counting Process Theory of Martingale Residuals.The first chapter discusses the basic characteristics of survival data, including the notion of censoring (in all of its various forms). Examples of the principle types of censoring are included. The chapter also includes introductory material on the general survival model, including a nice description of the log likelihood function. Curiously, the rigorous definition of the hazard function has been omitted, probably to avoid intimidating readers who are not familiar with formal limits.Chapter 2 continues to build up the general survival model and introduces the relationship between the survivor function and the cumulative hazard. Pointwise estimators for the survivor function are discussed, including the Kaplan-Meier estimator along with the various variance estimators. Test statistics for comparing two survival populations are introduced, including the Log-Rank and General Wilcoxon statistics. The reader is encouraged to read the counting process treatments of these statistics to see why they produced defensible hypothesis tests.Chapter 3 is devoted to the Cox Model and Cox's partial likelihood function. Tests for significance of the coefficients are introduced, included the Wald test, log likelihood ratio test and the score test. These are used heavily in the later chapters as the basis of a model-building methodology.Chapter 4 is a very short, but nicely written chapter explaining how to interpret the values of each regression coefficent. It also describes covariate-adjustment techniques for model diagnostics.Chapter 5 is just a wonderful chapter which outlines classical model building techniques. This is a great chapter for anyone who has ever been thrown a ton of data (with a bushel of possible covariates) and asked to ""fit a model to this stuff"".Readers who have done a lot of purposeful fitting of linear regression models won't find the basic techniques new, but use of survival specific residuals and selection criterion will probably be an eye-opener. The section on assessing the functional form for continuous covariates is also nicely written.However, the section on Best Subsets Selection was a little too ""cook-booky"" for my taste.Chapter 6 is another very nice chapter on goodness-of-fit. It discusses analysis of the various residuals and their use for analysis outliers, testing proportional hazards assumptions and overall Goodness-of-Fit.Chapter 7 discusses the standard extensions of the Cox model, including stratification and time-varying covariates. Chapter 8 discusses parametric survival models, and is a good introduction to the SAS procedure LIFEREG. The generalization of the Cox model to recurring event data (also know as Aalen's multiplicative intensity model) can be found in Chapter 9.My only complaint is that each chapter was designed to be read in one sitting. Individual ideas, topics and formulas can be buried in a seemingly unbroken chain of paragraphs. The lack of sub-sub section titles,etc, makes using the text as is somewhat cumbersome to use as a desk reference.

Dropping columns, adding new columns by calculations, dropping missing (NA) values--all the basics of whipping data into shape are described simply and directly.

"This title by mr. Kaminsky is I believe the de-facto reference for the DataFrames.jl package.The book offers a solid introduction to data analysis using the Julia language.The first part of the book (chapters 1-7) provide the reader with an overview of the ""essential"" Julialanguage skills, addressing syntax, data types, and from here on, it builds its way into dealing with data-intensive manipulation, mainly through collections, strings and time-series data.The second part of the book delves into the data analysis realm of the title, and shows how Julia can help the reader with the manipulation of DataFrames.The author starts with the basics of (t)his package, then in numerous examples shows how to create data frame objects, retrieeve their data, and  to do important operations with the data frame objects, i.e., convert and group, mutate and transform, etc.Some of the highlights in the book: * The author not only makes extensive use of DataFrames, but also of other packages for visualization, benchmarking, and even web-service creation to serve the data.* The companion sample code repository is very thorough, and not only contains pure julia files, but there are also notebooks in Jupyter and Pluto format* There a three generous appendices in the text, so the reader can A) learn to set up his/her Julia environment for the 1st time, B) find the answers to the proposed exercises in the text, and C) have an overview of recommended Julia packages for data analysis.Some of the parts I  found difficult (, or perhaps aren't my cup of tea):- Quite some of the examples offered have to do with the financial world. This perhaps comes from the formation/background of the author.- The physical text might be bulky, but then again, dealing with data, you might expect to see many tablesAll in all, this title might blend well with McNicholas' ""Data Science with Julia"", and/or Nazarathy's ""Statistics with Julia"" for the more scientific readers.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Julia for Data Analysis
"I am a beginner programmer who has previously dabbled in both R and Python. Julia has been on my radar for a few years (since the 1,0 release), but I have previously used Python and Pandas for my data wrangling needs.Kamińskis book begins outlining why Julia is a good fit for data analysis tasks with illustrative examples, and then reviews both strengths and weaknesses of the language. Part one of the book introduces Julia in general and the tools needed to work in the language in a structured manner. Part two builds upon part one and introduces data analysis in Julia.Kamiński writes in a friendly and very readable manner, both explaining different ways of accomplish tasks and also highlighting common errors or quirks. Boxes often provide additional detail, clarifies important points or links to sources providing additional information, which I appreciated. Many chapters are built around small projects (such as extracting exchange rate data or analyzing chess puzzles)  as a way to introduce concepts and tools, which gives good structure when learning.All in all this is an excellent introduction to both Julia and Data Analysis. Very little programming experience is needed in order to be able to use the material, and I feel it provides a very solid foundation for future projects in using Julia.In short Kamiński has written, what I consider to be, a pedagogical masterpiece!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Julia for Data Analysis

Where it really shines is as an excellent refresher on data analysis concepts and best practices (and not just beginner level - there are plenty of more advanced tips as well).This was one of the best books of its type that I've read - highly, highly recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Julia for Data Analysis

"Felix Zumstein (FZ), the author of ""Python for Excel"" (PfE), is an excellent technical writer. Throughout the book he strikes the perfect balance between brief, clear and informative. In the genre of technical writing, PfE is the nearest thing to a page-turner I've encountered. I can honestly say I learned something significant, interesting and useful on nearly every page of the book.Part I, Part II and the three appendices cover Python and the powerful pandas data analysis package. As an experienced coder with little prior exposure to Python, I found these sections of the book to be quick and easy to read, and I'm now using them as a reference that I turn to again and again as I bolster my Python skills. If you're looking to get up to speed with Python, I believe you'll find PfE to be a great resource, even if you don't plan to use Excel or VBA in your work.Part III and Part IV cover the bidirectional integration of Python with Excel and VBA, and usage of the xlwings package to simplify this complicated task. As an experienced Excel + VBA developer with considerable prior exposure to cross-platform work, I find using PfE + xlwings to integrate with Python to be a relative cakewalk. If you're looking to integrate Python with Excel and VBA, I believe PfE + xlwings is the way to go, and I strongly recommend them to you.I'll close by sharing some information about me for context. I've been developing quantitative models/applications for a long time, and I have considerable experience coding with C/C++, C# and S-Plus/R, and a lot of experience coding with VBA for Excel. As far as Python goes, though, I had only dabbled with it before now. I have a few Python books on my bookshelf, but none of them had inspired me to take the plunge and really learn it. Then PfE came along and, because I'm an avid Excel user and developer, I was excited to buy a copy and dive headlong into Python. PfE proved to be a tremendously worthwhile investment for me, both in terms of the nominal cost of the book and in terms of the considerable time to work through it. Python is now an indispensable tool in my coding tool kit; I've started developing a Python-powered Excel workbook add-in of my own, and I'm confident it will greatly streamline my quantitative development and quantitative analysis efforts in the very near future and for many years to come. Thank you FZ for sharing your incredible work with me, by way of the book and by way of xlwings.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Excel: A Modern Environment for Automation and Data Analysis
"I really just getting in to the book, but I really wonder why, on a book about a language called python with a snake on the cover, why not use a picture of a python instead of an imaginary species.  At first I thought it might be a king snake, but no white or yellow means this is not a king snake or a coral snake.  Pythons don't have banded makings at all.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Excel: A Modern Environment for Automation and Data Analysis
"This is a great introduction for industry based professionals looking for an introduction to Python for Excel. The author does an excellent job explaining Python fundamentals as they relate to common/intermediate excel functions. I highly recommend this book to professionals (especially managers and above) that interested in the benefits/limitations of Python programming for excel. If you’d like to learn the basics of Python and how the language can be used as a source of process improvement on your workflows, then this is for you.If you’re someone who has advanced experience in Python, data processing, and automated workflows, then you might benefit from reading through the following issues to see if this is the right book for you.1. A majority of the examples from the book load data stored in Excel based file format. There’s very little information on how Python can be used to load, clean, process, and convert flat files (csv, txt, dat, etc). Most data intensive automated processes interact with flat files, and it’s the most common file type used to import data. It was surprising to find that there wasn’t at least a chapter on preparing/importing data to Excel with Python. This is the main reason why I couldn’t give the book 5 stars.2. A lot of the more advanced topics/examples use custom packages (such as the parallel_pandas package). For more intermediate-advanced concepts, such as parallelization, they use functions built into these custom packages and leave out in-depth detains on how the code actually works.3. The major automation examples in this book uses xlwings. Xlwings is undeniable an incredible package, but by design, it’s main use is for building interactive applications in excel. This book may not be as helpful for you if you’re using an alternative excel package for non-interactive automated processes that function with task schedulers.All in all this is a great book for any business professional/data scientist that works with Excel on a regular basis. Despite the issues I noted, it’s one of the most comprehensive books about Python for Excel on the market.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Excel: A Modern Environment for Automation and Data Analysis
"This is the single most useful book I have read as a beginner/intermediate Excel user seeking modern tools for automating Excel and performing robust data analysis.  The content is presented in a logical, clear, and engaging manner starting with setting up modern tools and Python foundations to automation using pandas and xlwings to building full-fledged applications.  The author does a great job of guiding you carefully through the journey assuming only basic Excel knowledge.  Also, the book explains the reasoning behind why using Python is a superior choice to VBA and how it can be used to replace the functionality of most native Excel data analysis tools.  This book has saved me so much time and energy in my Excel tasks, while also increasing the accuracy and reliability of these tasks.

As others have said, it looks like MS rushed this book to the market, evidenced by so many errata, which can be disappointing especially when the solution is wrong. On the other hand, there are some very interesting and genuine uses of various Excel functions to solve business problems.I wouldn't recommend this book for beginners. If you're trying to learn Excel, this is not the book. It is not a book to teach excel, but a book to teach you what you can do with Excel to solve everyday problems, given you're familiar with the mechanics of excel.I would recommend it with these caveats.

It has MANY, MANY errors.From forgetting to take into account given growth rates detailed in a problem (therefore yielding incorrect answers) to just plain sloppy copying of sheets (forgetting to delete the drawings and numbers not pertinent to the current sheet).As said in a prior review, if an updated CD were to become available, with the CORRECT ANSWERS on it, this would be a definite 5 star.(This said, perhaps finding the errors on the CD could be a means of developing your spreadsheets skills):)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Microsoft® Excel Data Analysis and Business Modeling
"This book is aimed at a level slightly higher than the total beginner. On page one, for instance he assumes that you understand the statement SUM(A5000:A5049) means. Then he points out that writing SUM(USSales) would make it easier to understand. He then describes how to name a range of cells -- Not exactly what I'd call advanced, but certainly above novice.The first third, or so, of the book is on these kinds of slightly advanced procedures that you could get out of several Excell books. After that he kind of turns the approach around to things like ""Estimating a Demand Curve."" This is looking for what you want to do rather than just looking at a technique within Excell.Many of his chapters have fairly sophisticated subjects, ""Incorporating Qualitative Factors into Multiple Regression."" In this chapter he then looks at multiple factors that might go into predicting things like predicting sales, predicting the Presidential race - with fairly surprising results.In a couple of chapters he has a bit of fun, i.e. Chapter 73 is ""Picking Your Fantasy Football Team.""Excell is quite a powerful package. It can be used for a lot of things beyond just filling out an expense account. In this book a lot of non traditional uses are described in a very light but informative manner. It is a very well done book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Microsoft® Excel Data Analysis and Business Modeling

"So the material is much as expected a standard old school data structures style book, non pythonic, more for the understanding of old school CS structures.. But just using python code to do the same things.. It reads well and the content is well presented..However with that said, you can tell the author comes from and old school Java/C++ background as none of the variable names are descriptive at all making the code way harder to follow.. Typical old school computer science enumerating everything with J and i...  Using nondescript names like __a  for array or __pri for priority.. Rather then naming variables in a descriptive way, which would make the code far more readable....This is my only gripe about this book so far.. I am about 200 pages in.. and I have to re-read code over and over again to decipher the mess of non descript names and trace up and down the code to see what goes to what rather then just understanding the concepts... So clearly the author has ignored all wisdom over the last 20 years on using descriptive naming conventions for code readability which would greatly enhance this book if updated..If I was actually in a computer science program right now and I got handed this book I would think to myself..  yep to be expected. but reading it for fun to gain some new insights,  not so much enjoying bad naming conventions.. and this is an easy fix that could greatly enhance this book..",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Structures & Algorithms in Python (Developer's Library)

"I obtained my PhD in industrial engineering last year and joined industry upon graduation. I teach statistics at one of the commonwealth campuses of a large university and not only do I think this book does a phenomenal job of covering statistics as a practitioner (which believe me, many of my colleagues have forgotten and we have SO many uses for stats in our field), but I think every statistics instructor should read this book. Most statistics curriculums focus on calculations  and cramming a bunch of concepts down a student’s throat. While that’s fine and all, I’ve always strived to drive home the point of “why and HOW could I use this in a practical sense, and what am I being taught that’s truly practical in most situations?” This book covers just that…it’s no lie that most students will move on from statistics and forget most things, but the conceptual parts of this book are what make statistics more memorable and could be great points to bring up in a statistics course to make students better and more informed consumers of statistics (and will hopefully better prepare those who are going to go to grad school, as I suffered the fate of not having a good stats background in my undergrad years).

"As a beginner to R, I bought this book at the recommendation from Data Science for Fundraising: Build Data-Driven Solutions Using R and am so glad that I did. R4DS provides useful content to get started with R. The book consists of 5 main sections:1. Getting started (Explore)2. Data manipulation (Wrangle)3. Scripting (Program)4. Build models5. Presenting information (Communicate)Here’s a brief overview of each section:ExploreI was a bit puzzled as the book jumps directly into plotting using the ggplot library. Although the authors are clear that the purpose of introducing ggplot is to keep our motivation high, seeing the ggplot syntax without a whole lot of background can be confusing at first. But then the authors do a great job at explaining the various aspects of ggplot. So my advice to other R beginners is to just keep going forward!After the intro to ggplot, you learn about the basics of R, such as variables and functions, as well as intermediate topics such as writing scripts, manipulating data using dplyr, and lastly EDA. This section ends with a good overview of how to use RStudio to saves script files.WrangleThis section starts with an intro to tibbles, which is a new concept for handling data in R. This section is important since most of the functions in later chapters use tibbles, such as reading data from various sources. There are many important concepts that seem useful such as “tidying up” your data and cleaning data points (string and dates).ProgramThis is a function section that introduces data pipes. This section explores how to chain complicated data operations together. You also get to see some good practice in writing human readable code. Then the book jumps into using the power of R as a functional programming language. Once I feel more proficient, I will take a deeper look at purr.ModelNow, depending on your situation, you may not be interested in this section, which is focuses on predictive modeling. There are quite a few recipes that explore “why” questions. Definitely planning to come back to this chapter later.CommunicateThis section is useful because it introduces how to create reusablereports.Overall, this is my go-to book along with the book I previously mentioned. This book is a solid reference book for learning R. Another good thing is that the companion website is regularly updated and you can copy and paste the code examples directly into RStudio.

"Wickham and Grolemund have produced an excellent book that would help a beginning R user become very efficient in explanatory analysis. Unsurprisingly the approach that they expound utilises the ""hadleyverse"" a collection of packages (ggplot2 for visualisation, tidyr for reshaping, dplyr for selecting and filtering, purrr for functional programming, broom for linear models etc) that dramatically speed up most of the common steps involved in an analysis. One benefit of Wickham's involvement in these packages has been a coherent philosophy that sits behind them. It can be a little tricky when learning this philosophy, but the long term benefits are enormous.The book is broken up into a number of sections that effectively builds up the ability to ingest, transform, visualise and model datasets. A good portion of the book is available in an online version, to give you a taste of how it is written. Many have been following it as it was written. I have passed on copies of the book to a number of colleagues who were just starting out and the response has been uniformly positive. In my own case I was familiar with some of the these packages; ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, but found the book taught me purrr and how to better use the packages together.Probably my two biggest caveats to readers are that there are situations where packages from outside the ""hadleyverse"" maybe required. The authors do a great job of pointing this out, but it does pay in my experience to know data.table and lattice for example. Both because they can occasionally fit a problem better but also because you inevitably come across other people's code where these packages are used. The other caveat is that the modelling is a little rudimentary. Most of the examples are just fitting independent regression models, whereas it seems to me that a hierarchical model would be a better fit. Still these are small things and it would be silly to expect a single book to cover all of these areas.In short this is the book I would give to someone who was keen to learn about how to use R for data science. It reads really well building up the different components whilst still being a valuable reference if you just need a reminder of a particular package (what is the difference between tibbles and data frames again?). Even though a good portion of the book is available online, it is well worth it to have the full thing on your bookshelf (digital or otherwise). On a broader note with Max Kuhn (author of the excellent ""Applied Predictive Modelling"" with Kjell Johnson) joining Wickham and Grolemund at RStudio, it is a great time to start your R journey.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data"
"To anyone who may be unaware, all of the contents of the book are available for free online and are updated regularly. I purchased this book in October 2019 and it was already out of date compared the the version online. However, not enough out of date to deter me from using it.I prefer to read books in print versus online, which is the main reason I purchased this book. It also allows me to study while on a plane, which is very convenient. The book is great, easy to understand, and provides a lot of questions and examples to work through in each chapter.I’m halfway through the book now, and one complaint that I have is that the quality of the print leaves a bit to be desired. If you look at my photos, you’ll see that I drew boxes around certain words/letters. I had to do this because the printed lines were SO faint that I completely missed it the first time I read it. This made the chapter more confusing than it should have been. I had to reread it a few times before I made out the super faint boxes. I compared it to the online version, which had the lines/boxes clearly drawn. I also wish the solutions to the practice questions and exercises were printed in the book so that I could check my answers. However, the answers are available online...it just adds a bit of unnecessary hassle. Those are really my only complaints so far.Overall, good book for beginner R and data science learners.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data"
"I am very happy with this book.  Its easy to read and the exercises/code work and are applicable.  The text is clearly written and the supporting graphics are well constructed.  I have started working through some of the exercises in R and find them very helpful.  I bought this book after completing a graduate course in data analysis using R.  Much of the course was constructed around Hadley Wickham's work.  We used ggplot2 and tidyverse extensively.  We did not use this book in the course and I now wish we had used it as a desk reference.  This book is answering many of the questions I had.  It is also providing an overview of many basic concepts and tools in R and would have been helpful to have at my fingertips during my graduate course.  Google is a great resource, but a well written and easily sourced desktop resource like this is indispensable.  I am learning something new about R constantly...I would consider myself a late beginner to early intermediate user of R for data science/data analysis.  I often find books that cover the basics extremely useful, because its easy to forget.  So for me, this was a good buy - regardless of my skill level.  Others will have to make their own decision.  This book does not cover mapping in R.  In fact, there is a sentence in Chapter 1 that states - this book does not cover mapping.  I would like to have had more on that topic or a follow-up book committed to mapping and integration with other tools like Leaflet or ArcGIS.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data"
"I'll preface this review by saying that while I think this book has some significant problems, R seems to be much harder to find good tutorials for than any other programming language or computer topic I've ever learned (I've been a programmer for 15+ years).  I tried a Udacity course on R which ended up being so shallow that I feel like I learned more about R from 20 pages of this book than from hours of Udacity videos.  While I am becoming proficient in R from this book, I think that this book has some problems that have made it slower and more difficult for me to learn R.With the exception of the final few chapters, R for Data Science is informative and easy to understand during its explanation of R concepts and commands.  The biggest problem that I have with this book is with the exercises in each chapter.  Essentially, each chapter shows you to use a hammer, how to use a screwdriver, and how to use a saw, and then says build a birdhouse.  Building a birdhouse is more complex than using a hammer or a saw in isolation, and you may also need additional tools (such as a tape measure), which were never described in the chapter.  It would be much easier to figure out how to build a complete birdhouse if the book first showed how to build smaller scale projects, such as a small wooden box, rather than only showing how to use each tool mostly in isolation.  In that way, you'd get some examples of using tools together to construct something more complicated.Each topic has a few simple exercises, and also two or three exercises which are considerably more complicated than anything which was demonstrated earlier.  While I can figure out the solution eventually, I bought this book so that I can learn R as painlessly as possible.  It's frustrating to spend so much time trying to figure out a problem which I could have figured out much faster had I been give some better examples prior to the exercises.  Furthermore, no answers are given in the back of the book and there are sometimes exercises where a necessary command hasn't been shown in the book (I found a page online where another person had solved the exercises).In addition to the above problems, the last few chapters about formulas and modelling seem rushed and some concepts are poorly explained or barely explained at all (even though those concepts are used in the examples).This book will teach you enough about R to be manipulate and graph datasets and write some simple functions, although it may not give you enough information by itself to solve more complicated problems.  Once you start getting beyond dataset manipulation, modelling, and writing simple functions, you'll probably need another book to sufficiently understand those more advanced concepts.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data"
"I got through the Preface and about 60% of the first chapter and had to stopped.Before I get into the review to explain why I had to stop reading the book, it is important to note that this book is available online for free. I prefer print over screen, when possible. But if you don’t have a preference, just use that.Why did I put this book down midway through Chapter 1?Cascade of events that started w/ me requiring solutions to practice problems that are in the book.The only way to learn math and software development is by doing. Books on these subjects should ALWAYS contain exercise problems and solutions to those problems, either at the end of the chapter or by way of an appendix at the end of the book.The best solutions that I found are at jrnold's github page. I quickly noticed, however, that the answers posted on that site didn't quite fit the exercises in the book. When comparing the online version to the printed version (book), I noticed that exercises from the book had been reworded or completely dropped. So from the beginning of this year, when this book was published and released for sale, to this summer, it is apparent that many errors had been found and revisions needed to be implemented.There were so many differences between the online version and the book that I decided to stop reading the book in lieu of the online version.My 5-star Rating:The author does an excellent job explaining topics. He is very knowledgeable and it shows. With the amount of revisions in such a short time, however, I can't help but think that this book was rushed.But if I am stopped reading the book b/c of errors, why 5 stars? The book, by itself, might have gotten a 1-star review from me, but I am still going to learn from this author. The online version costs him/someone to keep up-to-date. Purchasing the book is an easy (and very fair) way to support this project.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data"
"I think this book is a perfect blend of technical training, visual reporting, sample datasets and clear communication.  The authors teach concepts in small chunks of code, and the code is pretty easy to interpretI will also be honest, it took me a few months of playing with “R” to get to a point where the syntax made sense(im still learning).  Im at the point, where i can read each chapter and im NOT getting confused at any of the topics(through chapters 1-5 so far).Im really starting to feel confident enough to take the breakthroughs to develop solutions that will be able to use at work very soon(maybe in a month or so)I had invested several years into Python and its great but my company locks python down but leaves R completely open (probably concerning the kernal access).  So i had to switch to R from scratch.  The transition was intimidating at first, but i plugged away and got the basics on my own.  Now im somewhat confident about subsetting, db connections, dataframes, ggplot and dplyr.  Im looking forward to defining functions and proc+packages in the near future.I really have to commend Hadley and the Grolemund for putting together a VERY DIGESTIBLE book.  The book is long, but it is easy to follow.I bought the physical copy and im so happy, i bought the digital copy(hard to find)Thanks,Chris Buck",5.0 out of 5 stars,"R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data"

"If you are going to be using R extensively, you'll want to dive into this book and get yourself set up to work efficiently and quickly in R.  It covers all the things you need to know about working in R and RStudio EXCEPT for the stats and analysis part.  You learn about getting data in, cleaning the data up (because who is ever given a clean dataset to start with?), exploring and organizing your data, a quick primer on ggplot2 (you'll want the 
R Graphics Cookbook
 for the full story), how to work with dates, different variable types, and write your own functions.  RStudio is more than just a coding environment - it's got all sorts of features to get you from code to interactive web graphics (shiny), practically self-writing results (knitr), and even something akin to a live lab notebook (R notebooks).  This book walks you through setting those up, as well as touches on finer points of things like vectors, models, and automation.  It's written at a level understandable to laypeople with a bit of coding experience, but doesn't assume you are a pro.  Hadley does a fantastic job of pointing out potential stumbling blocks where some functions might give you unexpected results.  If you can stumble through doing your stats and making a few graphs in R, then this book is your next step to being a professional R user.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data"

"This book was just released and I'm only a few chapters into it, but I can already attest that it's a fantastic treatment of the topic.  It reads like the book I would have written (or perhaps would have liked to have written) if I were to pen a volume on time series analysis.  It's a long overdue contribution to the subject, and I'm happy to see it executed so well.It's very well organized and written in an approachable style, yet does not shy away from the details.  It's clear that the author has a great deal of practical, applied experience and has ""been there, done that.""  For example, the chapter on data cleaning impressed me not only because she has the kind of background that impresses on one the importance of clean data, but also because the discussion mirrored many of the hard-earned lessons that I've wrestled with over the years.If you're interested in time series analysis as more than a purely academic exercise, you would be well placed to have this book on your bookshelf (or in your Kindle library, as the case may be).  I highly recommend it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Time Series Analysis: Prediction with Statistics and Machine Learning
"I'm about halfway through this book but it is a very easy read and great introduction into time series. A lot of books assume prior knowledge but this one feels like it takes many books and puts them together. It feels like three main segments: an intro to what time series is and the data processing steps, then the introduction of various models and forecasting, and the last segment being the application into machine learning. This is a very great read and I'm happy I purchased it.I would also like to say that those that complain about the book being written in 2 languages. This is not the book for you if you find it a burden to switch between R and Python. Do not use this book as a beginners guide to programming. That's not its purpose. In my opinion the book isn't hindered by using both but is better because you understand the significance of the libraries being widely available. Each language has its benefits and cons. And in my own career I've switched between both.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Time Series Analysis: Prediction with Statistics and Machine Learning

"This book explains the concepts in a non-mathematical way. So, if you do not have a mathematical background then you should be able to follow along. Codes in the book sometimes do not work but if you look at the github page for the book, these errors have been corrected.My biggest problem with the book is that it does not show you how to forecast beyond your dataset. For example, if you have a monthly/weekly dataset ranging from 2010-2022, then this book does not show you how to forecast into the year 2023. All the models (at least the classic models that the book has talked about, I haven't looked at the deep learning ones yet) divide the dataset into training and test data and then show you how the model is performing against the test data. Now, that we know the models are performing well, how about forecasting beyond the test dataset? That part is missing in the book. So, in my opinion the book helps you to understand forecast theory in a non-mathematical way but does not actually show you how to forecast past the test data that you have available. Another negative is that the book repeats a lot of stuff. It seems like the author is justifying the high price of the book with the number of pages (at close to sixty dollars, this book is pretty expensive for what it is trying to teach). So, two stars for the theoretical part and took away three stars for not showing how to forecast past the test dataset.When someone buys a book on forecast, they normally hope to learn how to forecast into the future and not just learn how forecasting works within their available dataset. This book fails miserably in this particular direction.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Time Series Forecasting in Python

"You are going to say I am being overly critical in my rating and review, and that I am biased myself. To his credit, Harford admits that he has friends on the left and leaves out his friends on the right. How am I supposed to interpret this in the context of his analysis of the climate change debate? Yet in a book about responsible use of statistics, how is the interpretation of data not supposed to be objective if one wants to gain maximum credibility?Harford appears to do with ""climate change"" what most other ""data detectives"" do - leaving out the elephant in the room. Somehow, the author seems to want the reader to believe that his thoughtful, unbiased perspective on climate change data is correct and therefore the rest of the book too on all the other topics.Harford thoughtfully addresses the issue of bias and how there is a certain type of bias that is extremely hard to overcome. Unfortunately, it seems he falls prey to it himself. What is this elephant that I am referring to? Population size. As scientists appear to have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt, climate change today is dwarfed by climate change events in the past even when there wasn't a single human being on the planet. The only difference with today is that ""climate change"" appears to jeopardize the comfortable way of life of the ""rich"" few, and the living space of the ""poor,"" mostlyby virtue of rising sea water levels. As humans we are now around to notice and get upset about it. Yet somehow, climate change activists want everyone to believe that between the ~1.5 billion of 1940 and ~7.5 billion today, the additional pollution, consumption and other habits of those extra 6 billion people should be discounted as trivial. Somehow, we are all supposed to believe that because we as humans are around to observe, measure, and interpret (biased or not) changes in the planet's climate, it is therefore only we who cause it and everybody who says it is not (only) us is obviously wrong.How am I supposed to not read the rest of the book with a huge grain of salt Mr. Harford? Why not suggest that population size could have an impact? Why not suggest that institutionalized narcissism/psychopathy is the root cause of our denial? Not the denial about climate change. I am talking about denial that we already have the solution. How many more credible alternatives to fossil fuel use do we have to invent for somebody with influence to take a pick and tell us all this is it? I am not talking about Elon Musk either with this flagrant display of a 100 year old technology that he didn't build and that causes so many negative side effects, presumably easily exported to less affected countries.Harford continues along the same line of a thin argument by addressing the anti-vaxx movement in what seems to be a one sentence denial of their motive. One study, Harford claims, put to rest the argument that vaccination would be the cause of autism. Never mind that there are many different kinds of autism, that autism exists on a scale (spectrum disorder, remember that distinction Mr. Harford?) and that apparently other studies show how in certain communities much higher rates of autism were found that could not be explained as a result of the natural process that Harford prefers to favor.The stories Harford otherwise shares to validate his opinions appear certainly entertaining. Perhaps no human is capable of writing a book about statistics completely free of bias. In this case, it seems I was unfortunately duped into believing ""Data Detective"" came close to accomplishing that goal.By the way, Mr. Harford, Amsterdam did not suffer starvation during WWII. That was only in the winter of '44-'45, the socalled ""Hunger Winter."" There appears to have actually been an economic boom in the Netherlands during the first years of the war. Perhaps it was because the Dutch simply wanted to survive after their government and the royal family left the country for greener pastures, or because the Dutch had a hunch that the Nazi regime would eventually bite the dust and more sensible Germans would gain the upper hand again, people with whom they had always had good trading relations.Having said that, it may be that Data Detective would have had much more of an impact for me if Harford had considered one aspect of statistics that seems often overlooked: context. While it may be relatively easy to extract data from a population, it may be less easy to interpret that data in the psychological and emotional context from which the data springs forth. If narcissism is as widespread and engrained as it appears to be, it would explain why society's problems have such a hard time being properly understood and solved.When one has as much data to process as Harford apparently went through to write a book, and finish it in a reasonable amount of time, it is understandable that not every topic gets the treatment it would seem to deserve in the eyes of some - well, me in this instance.",2.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Detective: Ten Easy Rules to Make Sense of Statistics

This book seems to have been targeted right at me.The Data Detective helps people think through the information they're attempting to process. The point is to get to the truth regardless of the information source. Chapter by chapter, Tim Harford explains the importance of things like recognizing that you bring your own emotions to data consumption, shifting your view of information, being curious about the backstory of data, demanding transparency even from big data sources and understanding what's missing from data. There are other ""rules,"" too. They're all just as practical as the ones I listed, and they all require a certain amount of self-awareness if you want them to help you swim in the world's flood of information.""Rule 3: Avoid Premature Enumeration"" was the chapter that spoke to me the loudest. It describes how and why agreeing on definitions is important. I'll admit I cringed over and over again as I realized how many times I'd inadvertently repeated incorrect headlines. Throughout this chapter, my mind was boggled over what I thought I understood but what I clearly hadn't thought about properly. The Rule 3 examples, like all the others in the book, are offered in a succinct, engaging style. They focus on the differences between headlines and realities.I learned in the Rule 3 chapter that I misunderstood:- the point of that big 2014 Oxfam inequality study,- how various definitions of an ""infant"" affect the infant mortality rates in the U.S. and elsewhere,- how a study determined whether playing video games caused aggressive behavior, and- all the ways a ""gun death"" might be defined.It's that last one that really made me think about how much I was taking definitions for granted. It also made me think about how the race for a headline can obscure what's important in a study and can lead to the wrong actions. Taking Rule 3 to heart is about recognizing that words usually are what confuse things, not numbers. Definitions need to match.Of course, that was just my favorite rule. There are nine others in The Data Detective. I read this book at about one rule / chapter a day to really absorb it, and I had to resist the urge to read more in a sitting. I freely admit I've been a Tim Harford fan ever since I read his first book The Undercover Economist. I've always been entertained by Harford's communication style, whether it's in his other books, in his Financial Times column, as the presenter for More or Less or in his new Cautionary Tales podcast. I feel like everything he's learned about communication in all those venues helps make The Data Detective so easy to read, informative and entertaining. It's a great guide to processing the information-rich world around us all.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Detective: Ten Easy Rules to Make Sense of Statistics
"An interesting book that presents 10 rules on how to make sense of statistics.1. Should learn to stop and notice our emotional reaction to a claim, rather than accepting or rejecting it because of how it makes us feel.2. We should look for ways to combine the ""bird's eye"" statistical perspective with the worm's eye view from personal experience.3. We should look at the labels on the data we're being given, and ask if we understand what's really being described.I can go on but you get the point. The book provides 10 simple yet helpful rules for better understanding statistics.  I love how each chapter featured an example that at first glance appeared to be inapplicable, but Tim Harford would show you how said example demonstrates the particular statistical rule. Every kind of example you can think of, and every type of story you can think of, is featured in this book. Usually, that's a turn-off for me but Tim did a great job of somehow connecting that seemingly off-topic example to the specific rule/takeaway of the chapter.  I was able to learn so much from this book through Tim's storytelling.The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that there were some chapters where the interesting story or interesting example wasn't there or like...where the author would just turn into your typical kinda boring statistics teacher. This is ironic because Tim emphasizes that the only way to change someone's mind is to get them curious, and the only way to get them curious is to make what you're presenting entertaining or attractive. Well, let's just say that in my opinion there were certain chapters where I felt like Tim kinda slacked on applying his own advice. Chapters where someone involved in statistics would love them, but an outsider like myself would find them dull and uninteresting. These portions of the book were few and far in between though so yeah this book was still a great book to read.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Detective: Ten Easy Rules to Make Sense of Statistics
"Darrell Huff's classic book, How to Lie with Statistics, warns us not to get misled by statistics. In this book, Tim Harford tells us how to see the Truth with statistics. He gives us ten rules of thumb for thinking about reported numbers. But the real reason for reading the book is for all of the stories Harford tells to illustrate each rule. It's like the greatest hits from the BBC radio show he has hosted for years.Here is a simple summary of the ten rules:1. When considering new information, pay attention to how it makes you feel. Your emotions can influence you to dismiss accurate statistics that you do not like and to embrace false statistics that you do like2. Sometimes your personal experience (a worm's eye view) conflicts with a bird's-eye view statistic. For example, the subway may be only half full on average during the day but packed every time you ride it (during rush hour). Both perspectives help you understand the truth.3. Make sure you understand what is being counted. When counting beans, the definition of a bean matters.4. Look for information that can put a statistic into context, like the trend, the scale, or how it compares to other situations.5. Try to learn where the statistics came from (the backstory) – and what other data might have vanished into obscurity.6. Ask who is missing from the data, and would our conclusions differ if they were included.7. Ask tough questions about algorithms and the big datasets that drive them, recognizing that without intelligent openness they cannot be trusted.8. Pay more attention to the bedrock of official statistics – and the sometimes heroic statisticians who protect it.9. Look under the surface of any beautiful graph or chart. Don't let the beauty mislead you.10. Keep an open mind, asking how we might be mistaken and whether the facts have changed.Those ten tips sound boring, but Harford's stories are not. Most of them show the power of useful statistics. As Harford says: ""Good statistics are not smoke and mirrors; in fact, they help us see more clearly. Good statistics are like a telescope for an astronomer, a microscope for a bacteriologist, or an X-ray for a radiologist.""",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Detective: Ten Easy Rules to Make Sense of Statistics
"As someone who has made a career in the fields of engineering, quality and statistics, I have encountered more than my fair share of both bad statistics and cynical dismissal of even thorough analysis.  So I enjoy reading articles and books that are both positive about the good that statistical analysis can do, but also frank about the pitfalls that come from our own patterns of behavior.Data Detective 🕵️‍♂️ stresses the importance of bringing our whole selves to any view of data - whether the casual viewing of an info graphic or an in-depth scientific journal, someone else’s analysis or our own efforts.  Each chapter forms a link in the chain of responsible analysis and reading, a sort of checklist of items to remember as we look at information - things that can be easy to forget when we are either at the ‘worm’s eye view’ in the weeds of the data, or so emotionally invested that objectivity is difficult.It is easy to find charged areas that make objectivity difficult - politics, social and human rights issues, environmental issues, economic justice, and so on.  But depending on where, when, how affluent, and numerous other criteria of your birth and upbringing, you carry a set of assumptions and normative structures that will bias every encounter with new information.  But as we see in the examples, those predispositions don’t need to rule our lives, we can open our minds to new information, allow ourselves to be wrong and to adjust to new ways of thinking rather than staunching claim our rightness as a ‘hill to die upon’.We are all biased, we all have preconceptions about things, we all have stuff we’re wrong about, we all have limitations ... it is what we do in the face of new data about ourselves and the world that matters.And this book doesn’t give us the answers - but it helps with some tools to guide us on that journey to discovery.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Detective: Ten Easy Rules to Make Sense of Statistics

"I cannot say enough good things about Tim Harford’s clear and concise demystifying critical topics. I first became a fan of the Cautionary Tales podcasts, and there’s some overlapping material here.  But he provides critical tools for thinking about how to parse the vast array of statistics and news stories that are thrown at us daily.  Should be required reading for consumers of media.  It will be interesting to see how the book ages with many references to the coronavirus pandemic. I think it would have been just as good without them, and might not have dated the book quite so much.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Detective: Ten Easy Rules to Make Sense of Statistics
"I read the first chapter and already can tell it’s institutional biased garbage. Tip for the writer; if you want to capture an audience and open their curiosity/understanding of a topic like statistics and convince them that you are an objective unbiased actor —don’t use loaded meaningless language like “Climate Change Deniers” and isolate one side as listening to “fake news”. Pretty much no-one denies the climate is changing, that is an intentional obfuscation of the argument. This guy from the first chapter is trying to suggest that our problem is that we aren’t trusting institutional statistics enough while downplaying the serious lies, slander, and misdirection a decent size of our legacy media and other institutions peddle in (except for big Tobacco that is, always have to use that tired old evil example but ignore incentives of other big actors including the government) . His argument is that we have too much doubt and we need to just trust more and he will show us how. Somehow I get the feeling he’s part of the same problem he’s complaining about in Darrel Huff. Having trouble getting past this first chapter. Likely will return so as to not waste my money.Overall his approach of making statistics seem irrefutable is misleading. Most all statistics is inferential and assumes we have proper and relatively complete/exhaustive data points. However, it misses the point because not all things are perfectly measurable and are easily put in proper context. This would actually apply to most of the complex topics we struggle with answering today.",1.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Detective: Ten Easy Rules to Make Sense of Statistics

"There is some good stuff in here.I like Knaflic’s focus on intentionality. For her, the defaults are something that should be avoided, or at least justified.I like how she looks at the presentation of graphic information as a story arc. There is one thing that you want to focus on to create actionable decisions. This is best, as she describes, if you are presenting. There are limitations if you have a static document that has information for multiple stakeholders.The book is accessibly written with a clean font and plenty of examples.However, I do have to push back a bit. She follows Tufte in trying to eliminate data ink. Part of the intentionality is that you have less and less information on the page and every thing you includes helps tell your story. For me though that leads to a sameness. You want your audience to not have to think so hard. You want to make sure they don’t have their eyes glaze over. But that means that everything is very simple with a muted palette. The author notes that some of these are just her preference, but the mode of thinking has become influential. Part of me wants my audience to do some work in understanding the text I put in front of them. It means a level of engagement that I worry a too-simple graph leaves out.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals
"As someone deeply invested in the world of data visualization, I approached ""Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals"" with high hopes. Unfortunately, my expectations were met with disappointment. This book, which purports to be a guide, barely scratches the surface of what could have been an enlightening exploration into data storytelling.The primary issue lies in the content's lack of depth. It reads more like a cursory overview of widely known concepts rather than an insightful guide. For beginners, it may serve as a rudimentary starting point, but for anyone with even a modest background in data or business, it offers little more than a reiteration of common knowledge. The examples and case studies, though well-intentioned, are overly simplistic and fail to challenge or engage the reader.Moreover, the book lacks innovative techniques or fresh perspectives, which are crucial in a field that is rapidly evolving. The author misses a golden opportunity to delve into the more nuanced aspects of data storytelling, such as how to weave narratives in complex data sets or tailor visualizations to different audiences.""Storytelling with Data"" falls short of its potential. It may serve as a light read for absolute beginners, but for those seeking to truly advance their skills in data visualization and storytelling, this book is not the resource they need. It's a disappointing reminder that not all guides are created equal, and in this case, what could have been a valuable resource ends up as a mere collection of basic principles most professionals are already familiar with.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals
"I work in the project controls arena of large projects that have hundreds, if not thousands of people working on them. A key requirement for project controls is to keep all project personnel informed about the project status. Needless to say engineering plays a major role on these projects and brings lots of data with them; pages and pages of it. As the author points out the analytical types are not necessarily trained on how to tell a story (i.e. communicate) with their data.For the last 10 years or so, I have developed methods for getting the project story down to a single graphic. It's usually a large graphic, but a single one. It has the effect of getting everyone on the same page. But for people who are not used to looking at this type of presentation, it can be overwhelming or as the author points out they have to work at it in order to understand it. This was a key point for me.Before I finished the book, I started making changes in my work products. They were small changes, but the feedback was very positive. One example, do you ever note information in page footers like date, time and maybe filename and path? Does anyone think to put them in the background by using a shade of gray instead of the default black? No! Try it. Then ask for opinions It doesn't sound like much, but it's reducing the competition on people's focus.This book is great! It's fairly short to read and has a lot of examples making it easy to follow the author's intent. She obviously is very good at her profession. If I had to pick one book as a recommendation to someone who wants to learn about making great presentation graphics, I will point to this book. I highly recommend it.

"My headline should be rather obvious, but I saw a review or two criticizing the explanations of the way certain formulas,unrelated to excel, work and the more statistical concepts given in the text.

"I have used Excel for well over 35 years, just after I got rid of Lotus in the mid 80s. I have written books on writing business plans, I have prepared hundreds if not thousands of financial models, I have done over 35 start ups as investor or CEO. Thus I know Excel from the business perspective. However every once in the while I want to use some function I have not used and need a quick reference. I thought this would be one on Kindle.However this is a highly disorganized random set of simplistic examples and in the Kindle format near impossible to find anything. I guess it is classic Microsoft.The prime example is if you forgot a ""what if"" model better just go to you tube and fish around. Don't try this.

"I gave this book to my undergraduate student Alex Hung Chen (U. Washington Seattle) to read. Here are his reviews on the first two chapters. I may post more as Alex reads further.Chapter 1This book was surprisingly entertaining to read for me. The organization was great and really gives a thorough introduction to someone that isn’t that familiar with error analysis. The only paragraphs that gave me some confusion was the probability section, did not quite understand the point. However, overall it really gave me an insight to why we do so many things we do in lab, especially during the past few months! To me it explains two things to me clearly, what error analysis is and why it is important. Also, really appreciate the tips and advice for conducting experiments, data collection, and error analysis he gives as the chapter goes along, I find it helpful as someone that just started to experience the professional scene of science.Chapter 2I was blown away by the amount of false knowledge on significant figure I had after reading the second chapter. I think there could actually be a bit more explanation under the examples. It was a bit confusing why some examples were correct, and some weren’t. The significant figure section was overall very informative, and I felt like I was able to review and learn many things that I didn’t focus much on. The section on the primary statistics is quick to the point and easy to read, the concepts are generally easy to understand since they are quite standard. Not sure if the equations displayed are meant to be understood or just as a reference, could be confusing to someone not familiar with mathematical symbols.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Error Analysis: The Science of Measurements, Uncertainties, and Data Analysis"
"This is a clearly written book on a subject that is often not very clearly taught. Jack Merrin gently guides the student through the fundamentals without condescending or wasting words.

In addition, the MATLAB code examples make this book stand out as being much more relevant than comparable books, as adept programming skills are now as valuable, if not more than, a solid grasp of the mathematical concepts of error analysis. I highly recommend this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Error Analysis: The Science of Measurements, Uncertainties, and Data Analysis"

"There is a whole sub-culture of food porn, the lavish coffee table books that set out to educate you to an entire culture through its food. I once saw a library of several hundred.These are page flippers – doesn’t that look marvelous, we’ll have to try it next time we find halibut cheeks. The sad fact, though, is that any of these books are lucky if the owner actually uses one or two of its recipes and exalted if a recipe becomes a dinner party staple.The first edition of R Cookbook by Paul Teetor, published in 2011, was, in analogy, similar in that it provided flavors with good recipes, many of which proved useful for specific needs.The second edition, just out with J.D. Long as co-author retraces and updates much of the content of the first edition, brings RStudio and tidy tools to bear, and subverts the dominant paradigm. You flip through it and it first appears to be the cookbook equivalent of granny’s index card recipe box. But it starts off with enough new that you stop flipping pages and start reading.It took me two days to read the 554 pages. I had the help of several airplane hours, but it would have been a page turner anyway. What captivates is the rigorous R tutorial cleverly hidden in asides, call-out boxes and brief explanations of why a particular code chunk does one thing when you might reasonably expect another.In my childhood, Donald Duck had three nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie who got their uncle out of more than one jam by consulting The Junior Woodchuck Manual, which somehow contained the answer to any question that could possibly arise. The R Cookbook, 2ND Ed. comes close to that standard for the beginner to intermediate user who is completely innocent, on the one hand, or who has been covertly using functions without a well-founded understanding of their requirements and limitations.It would be an unconventional choice, perhaps, but this is the book that I would choose for the text if I were teaching a course in introductory R. Why? Because this book tells you what R does, not what it is. Any student coming to it with even an imprecise notion of f(x) = y is going to be able to follow along to the point, perhaps, of wanting to write her own package. The text doesn’t cover this, but points you in the right direction, and suggests source(“good_stuff.R”) as an interim step.In other words, its approach is like R’s, functional, not imperative, definitional not procedural. In my view, the implications in the R vs. Python wars are obvious. In one model, Professor Higgens tells Eliza bring me my slippers. In the other, he first has to declare a subject (the slippers), a possessive (my slippers), object (grammatical, me) and then, with the verb, provide detailed instructions on where they are to be found, how brought into possession and the means by which they are to be transported to their destination.Someone once said something to the effect that assembly language uses humans as pre-processors. I’m afraid that is true of many of its do-this, then do-that descendants.For now, their defense is the superiority of compiled programs in speed on the metal and the much more expensive wetware. And they are right for the one-off case. But as cases proliferate or become abstracted, wetware costs go up faster than throughput advantages.It will not happen while I’m still sentient enough to follow, but a compiled R or an R to Haskell API does seem to provide the best of both worlds. Put the wetware where it belongs, in defining the problem and the appropriate solution and leave the optimization to languages that are good at implementing functional logic.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis, Statistics, and Graphics"

"TLDR: To be successful with this book you need a basic understanding of statistics, and the willingness to work through problems solving methodically. In return you will get a solid understanding of R that is at an advanced beginner level.I teach an intro stats class, but to Honors students. So every semester I have a fairly large handful who want to go beyond the Excel and online sources we use in that beginning class to do more complex work. Sometimes this is just because they are interested, but often it is because they are working in labs and nobody knows how to do the stat. Excel does not cut it past a basic ANOVA so they come looking for more power (get it? Stats joke?) SPSS and SATS are just crazy expensive, and I see the writing on the wall that software is moving toward open source, like R so I try to encourage them in that direction.  I do not teach R in the class and so I need a sources the students can mainly use to learn on their own with a little help during office hours. I have been loaning out R for Dummies by de Vries and Learning R by Cotton out, I have the earlier R cookbook by Teetor alone but that book seemed only comprehensible to my really hard core STEM students and was getting a little long in the tooth. So I jumped at reviewing this version.I am still going to stick with loaning out R for Dummies to my softer science and non science students with less math and programming experiences. It holds their hands a little more and walks through RSudio more slowly. And does not throw around terms like functions and PERL and matrix so casually.  But this book is great for my STEM students with a little bit of determination and logic skills. I like the structure better than the previous book, it focuses more on actually understanding what you are doing  which in the long term is more useful than a bunch of tricks. Working through this book will result in a pretty solid understanding of the basics in R and a bit past that as well.This book mostly assumes you understand the underlying statistics, which is fine, I doubt those who do not are going to be venturing into programming in R.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis, Statistics, and Graphics"

If, like me, you find yourself switching between many of them, this book is a great resource.This book assumes you already have some understanding of GIS and spatial analysis, which is a reasonable assumption.

There is also a welcome new chapter on performance issues. The most important strength of this book remains the same: It shows SQL the way it is actually used for business analysis. I don't think there is a single INSERT or UPDATE statement in the book, and that's fine because we rarely use them in our line of work.

"It could just be a reflection of the existing paradigm in which the subject of data analysis has been and is still being taught today, but I've been repeatedly surprised by the clarity and order brought to each subject by this unique book - a clarity and order I've never experienced - and always sought - from every other data analysis/statistics text/class I've utilized.Though I studied some math and statistics in grad school, because I really got into programmatic data analysis in the work force most of my knowledge and skills are self-taught, so that's my perspective. But I've complained for years to anyone who would listen 🙂 that I simply didn't understand why these subjects are taught as they are: as a collection of methods/calculations which address particular analytical challenges. My experience has been that this teaching paradigm both limits my understanding and recall of the use of these methods because there's no overarching structure within which I can understand their relevance. Here's a book on regression, another on exploratory data analysis, another on prediction, another on hypothesis tests - under what conditions, to address which challenges and in what order are these techniques employed? I've felt largely left to cobble together my own methodology. This book however unifies these methods into an understandable process, allowing me to appreciate their relevance and use at different stages of a data analysis project. Because I understand their relevance, the methods make more sense to me and are more deeply ingrained into my memory. And because I'm viewing a start-to-finish process which has some order and clear objective, I can replicate that framework for my own data analysis projects. Of course I understand that no analytical project - or any advanced methodology - can be a strictly A-to-Z affair, and as one's understanding matures they are able to recognize when digressions from a framework are warranted. But, for me at least, and particularly in this subject, a unified understanding of the objective and general process is critical for me to be able to make informed choices about which methodology or technique to use under what conditions and with which objectives.Also, and I also can't emphasize this enough, there are almost no errors  (OK, a couple of simple typos)!!!! This in an era when books (particularly these books) are published with seemingly little to no editing! I don't know whether authors who allow their work to be published with errors understand how that might corrode the confidence of their readers, but that's certainly the case for me. On a couple of occasions - perhaps trained by my prior textbooks - I've thought myself close to catching the authors in a mistake or omission: ""Ah - they forgot to mention that! Aha!"", or ""Here we are, they left out a description of that just like all the other books!"", only to find the next page held the relevant answers/explanation in clear text. Many subjects which I've found are seemingly taken for granted in other textbooks - weighting, rationale and nature of natural log transformations, use of regression residuals, even a simple understanding of the difference between parametric and nonparametric methods - all of these subjects are given thoughtful and clear treatment in this text.Finally, the R code! I read through the text, then work through the code for each chapter's case study in R Studio, and the code on its own is worth (perhaps more than) the price of the book. Besides further enhancing my understanding of the text, it demonstrates good code-writing technique and R usage, and also gives me a plethora of templates I can refer to in my own data analytics work. I'm thinking about how much effort it must have taken people on the authors' team to develop the R visualization templates and all the R code - not to mention the code in the other languages (Python and Stata code is also included). It seems it must have been a monumental undertaking.In summary, I have tens, perhaps close to a hundred of the yellow Springer books and all their relatives from the different publishing houses adorning my bookshelves and this text is the first to really make me start to feel (I'm only a third through the book) I can do this stuff on my own because I understand what I'm supposed to do - not a detached method or a technique but an entire process and framework. For anyone who is learning this subject on their own, is in school and would like a more comprehensive and systematic explanation of this craft, or out of school working and would appreciate a one-stop overview of the data analysis process and rationale, this text is a clear, thorough, and I believe invaluable learning tool.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy"
"The book is the legacy of late Kézdi who unfortunately passed away a couple of months after the book was published - at the young age of 50. The topics the authors chose as case studies show their academic and personal interests: Kézdi researched discrimination on the workplace, this is reflected in cases on gender and age difference in earnings. Later he turned to health economics and this is shown in case studies on life expectancy, smoking as a health risk, and effects of immunization of children. Békés researched international trade and competitiveness and real estate prices, this is reflected in cases on hotel and home prices.The book is very well written so it is easy to read. I checked the cases on finance with great detail as this is a topic I myself did some research on and found them very accurate. I was especially pleased that they noted that when you convert a variable to logs you should not forget to correct for the half of the variance otherwise the estimation of the mean will be biased – this was missing from my econometrics books when I did my studies. I also liked the “Under the hood” parts as I am the type who wants to dig deeper into theory to understand why formulas work.All in all, this is a great book I can recommend both for current students and practitioners who want to brush up their knowledge with the latest methods in econometrics or rather … data analysis.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy"

"This book is amazing and it's most definitely going to be so for years to come.A bit about my background I'm not studying data analysis formally such as in a college or university but rather with my own curriculum we could say. So anyone that maybe feels intimidated by the idea that this book might be just for college students shouldn't be at all 😀. Mostly because the book is extremely accessible for a beginner with the way it builds on previous chapters which is something the authors seemed to have mastered.Before purchasing the book I read through the preview (something I recommend everyone does for every single book they are looking to purchase) and I fell in love with the teaching style and also having skimmed the table of contents after, I knew I had to purchase the book since what would be covered was highly relevant to me.Now 9 months later it helped me get my first data analysis job. I also haven't even read the book completely through I got to ch.16 (more or less) and stopped to study some other things. Then when I came back I decided to start from the beginning and absorbed even more and now I'm in the process of finishing it . Then I plan on reading it again lol since there's much information contained in the book including references to external works.So for me I really I have no complaints, I was just kind of sad you had to be a university professor to get access to the answers for the questions but the fact the code for the book is freely available on GitHub more than makes up for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy"
"Data Analysis for Business, Economics and Policy is an excellent and much needed companion for practitioners in various policy fields. It is not simply a textbook on a broad range of methods, but a hands-on guide for data analysis in practice. It guides the reader firmly through the process of actual empirical analysis, demonstrating how to answer policy and business questions through a broad set of case studies. While covering a large variety of topics, the book never looses focus of the most acute problems practitioners are likely to face. It should be definitely included in the welcome package of every junior data analyst.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy"

"In the ever-evolving world of data analysis, ""Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter"" shines as a beacon for beginners and experienced data enthusiasts alike. It is a testament to the book's caliber that it manages to comprehensively cover Python's powerful data manipulation tools in such an approachable manner.The book's primary strength lies in its thorough exploration of data wrangling. For the uninitiated, data wrangling is the art of maneuvering raw data into a more digestible form for analysis, and this book nails it. By delving deep into the intricacies of libraries like pandas and NumPyWhat's particularly commendable is the balance between theory and practice. While it's brimming with technical details and explanations, it never feels overwhelming. Instead, readers are constantly engaged with practical examples, ensuring that learning is both meaningful and applicable.Whether you're a beginner stepping into the world of data or a seasoned pro, this book offers invaluable insights and skills that will enhance your data-wrangling journey.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter"
"No doubt the author has knowledge about the subject. He's a respectable professional in the area and the creator of the pandas package. But once more in life, we see that knowing a subject doesn't give you the tools for teaching it. If you, like me, have learned from other resources about python, numpy, pandas, and the rest of the items touched on in the book, then, you occasionally will add some little tip that perhaps you didn't pay attention to before.Also, the way the author explains the different uses of the packages is not very clear. I found myself reading the book and jumping all the time to Google or other sources to clarify some things or for simpler examples that enlightened me to return back to the examples in the book. I would like to rate the author with five stars and the book with less than that. But, it's not possible so I rated it with three stars.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter"

There's a lot of bad grammar creating sentences that don't really make sense, and just random words that don't belong. The organization is poor - it doesn't teach things in a logical order, but assumes you know things in one chapter before explaining them in the next chapter. And it is REALLY long.

"I've only written a review once before, but this book demands a response.As my title says this is the first truly modern beginner's data analysis text. It put complicated matters - and a modern text has to be more complicated - ing understandable terms, it puts students into coding from the first using R and R Studio, the subjects are presented effectively (the second chapter has the best explanation of an average treatment effect I've ever run across), and the entire waterfront is covered. The text also put probability in its place; it isn't introduced until chapter 6. I should explain further that I'm working through the book myself to sharpen my data analysis skills up as well as to evaluate the text. And I'm leaning a lot from Llaudet and Imai's approach to R.Another aspect of the text I really like is that Llaudet and Imai have obviously read some good teaching texts. The book recognizes one of the most overlooked aspects of using a text: students don't read assignments all the way through at once. The text is strewn through with marginal notes recalling prior material, giving (and recalling) tips on concepts and coding, and each chapter ends with ""cheatsheets"" on concepts, R symbols, and R functions. All texts should be structured like this.I have only a few complaints. First, Llaudert and Imai seem to assume that students will know why data analysis Is done in the first place. There is no treatment of how science works or why we do it. There is also no introduction to modeling, except in relation to data analysis itself. This leaves out a good deal of the modeling process. My guess is that the authors are assuming that their work is being used with supplemental texts or that these subjects have already been introduced. Second, I would have preferred a little more John Turkey in the analysis. But I'm funny that way.If you are planning to teach a course in ""research methods"" or the like, you should definitely strongly considered htis book. I'll use it the next time I teach the subject.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis for Social Science: A Friendly and Practical Introduction

The book seems fine. I like the author’s approach. It’s similar to his Essential Reference title.I was just disappointed that my book arrived severely damaged.

"D. Beazley is a) a Python authority; b) one of the best lecturers on technical matters (just check his countless keynote PyCon talks); c) an accomplished Python author (favorite book until this one: ""Python Cookbook (2nd ed). In the past, I took two Python classes from him, and during the first I asked him whether ""Learning Python"" or ""Programming Python"" were good first books on the language. He said that no, they were too long, and that he preferred ""The Quick Python Book"", then still in its 1st edition. I am mentioning this episode, because I have the impression that Dave wrote his ideal version of ""The Quick Python Book"". This book's content is informative not only for what is covered in it, but also for what is left out. In his lectures and books Dave has been an advocate of ""minimal"", elegant Python. Over the years, Python has inevitably become a huge language. Syntax extensions, programming tools, and two gazillions of libraries make it a sometimes daunting language. But Python was--and still is!--a ""language that fits your brain"". There is *a lot* of stuff you can do with good native data strucutures and essential Python constructs. The resulting code will also more readable. If you thought that Kernighan & Ritchie was a complete book on C, and ""Javascript: the good parts"" a great book on Javascript"", then you'll love this book. Like the other two, it describes the language and gives essential programming advice. Not a single sentence is superfluous, and not a single language feature presented is redundant. In the first 30 pages, a newbie will learn enough Python to write useful scripts and maybe complete programmin assignment in college. The rest of the book covers functions, OOP, generators, I/O. The reader who goes carefully through the enitre book will master Python by the end, and be ready for cherry-on-top books like ""Fluent Python"". Because the book is just 300 pages, it is readable front-to-back (who ever did this with ""Learning Python""?). Because it is condensed and carefully written, it won't be read in a couple of sessions, though; and this is not a book for people new to programming. Experienced programmers, and even experienced Python programmers, will get out of it insights into the language that have made Beazley such a loved pythonista. Summing up: if you are new to Python, make this the one book you buy. If you use Python already, read the book to appreciate aspects of the language that may have escaped you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Distilled (Developer's Library)
"If you must read one book on Python make it this book. This is the best introductory Python book for an experienced programmer I have come across, though I will admit it is the first I read.David wastes no time in getting you just the knowledge you need to understand the Python language.I was new to the Python language before I read this book. Prior to reading I had done some Googling, a few tutorials, and a few small scripts though I knew I didn't really know Python and was not familiar enough to feel comfortable with the language.After reading the book I can say I know what it means to be ""Pythonic"" and what the major parts of the book are. I highly recommend reading the book all the way to the end including the last few chapters on modules, the standard library, and the builtins. You will be well-rewarded.I will be moving on to Fluent Python after this book yet I am very glad I read David's Python Distilled first since it was an easy, quick read that set the stage in my mind for what Python is as a language. And plus, Fluent Python is well over twice as long. David gets you up and running fast.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Distilled (Developer's Library)

"Python - what you need to knowThis is a great book for two reasons:1) relative to the number of Python books that are published today, there are few that focus on the core language as opposed to an application or domain like data science or machine learning; this is one, and a good one.2) the book is useful, concise, and factual (very little opinion or promotion).For developers who are not fond of Python but are forced to use it for more than six months or so (I have met a few over the years), especially C++ and Java programmers, I would recommend this book exclusively. It is short, about 300 pages and, for an experienced programmer, is very readable and comprehensible. Concerns about type checking, for example, are addressed specifically with tips on what accomplishes a given objective (hints versus enforcement). The book may not make you fall in love with Python, but it will make your journey less painful and confusing.For those of us who like scripting in Python, there is still much to learn or re-learn. Little things, like ""and"" and ""or"" keywords returning one of the joined values instead of a straight boolean True/False value, are good to know and may save a painful bug down the line. The chapter on classes and object oriented programming was for me the toughest to get through; still, my thought the whole time I was reading it was, ""Wow, I am glad Beazley laid this all out so I don't have to.""This was time and money well spent.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Distilled (Developer's Library)
"If you know David Beasley's work from his many talks, this book reflects his personality and deep understanding of Python. He's not covering every last thing - he's telling you what works and what you need to know. Which is what experienced coders from other languages really need, as well as those who have at least a year of Python coding and want to up their game.Dave dives in, and his code examples (of which there are many) are tight and the descriptions are concise. Those looking for lots of words are going to have to find them elsewhere. Maybe in his other books. But this book doesn't wait for stragglers - keep up.He doesn't just explain what, but why. Understanding his recommendations is the real value in this book as there are few that have more experience with Python (see videos on his website if you doubt this).This book will take you very far in Python, but it doesn't cover IDEs or a lot of non-core (standard library) modules.  I wish it had covered more in managing your environment and troubleshooting the inevitable problems that crop up over time.Anyone can write a book on python and it seems that most do. But if you are looking for a wise investment of your limited time and book space, this is one of the very few I recommend spending your also limited money on.

"Through Chapter 4, I was absolutely thrilled with this book. It was just right for my level of experience. The beginning of each section was comfortably familiar and by the end I was learning a lot. In the middle of Chapter 5 on functions, I couldn't just read and comprehend anymore. To understand it, I'd need to sit a computer and my own examples and play with the ideas. I'm not ready to do that yet, there's still a lot of new stuff for me that is easier to get at. I'm skipping to Chapter 6.The Kindle edition is disappointing. The typeface in Chapter heads is inconsistent. If you follow the author's suggestions to look at source code, it screws up your furthest page read, which makes it hard to swap between devices.

"These authors have done a good job of explaining a good part of beginner's python. After reading several other python books, there are a few that really do a better and more thorough job of explaining many more aspects of Python features than this book does. The real python coding basics was only in the first 1/2 of the book (Books 1-3). The second half (Book 4-7)was AI, hardware, robotics, and other non-elementary subjects. For those going into coding as a profession, this advanced stuff was probably great for a heads-up into what is going on in coding today. I would have preferred that the authors spend the entire book on Python features (as some authors did in books as big as this one with ALL Python features), instead of just half. Negatives - I did have problems reproducing the ""web scraping"" examples and the web downloading data examples in the book. The author's own web page would not work, but I tried the examples with other web sites which worked, but I had to do hours of research on the web to get some things to run. Also, as important as web interaction is today, they spent little time on it. The chapters on using Artificial Intelligence really went to advanced coding in a hurry. The neural network discussion was very advanced, and I didn't even try to follow along with the coding. And the authors assumed that everyone would be using Anaconda, which I do not. I could not get some packages and modules that they use to work even after hours on downloading, tweaking, etc. I was trying to follow along with PyCharm and had some problems. I did all the typing/coding myself, which is the way to learn, but it would have been nice if all the examples were provided (only the AI coding examples were on the Dummies web site) so that I could see if it was in fact a typo on my part or mistakes in the book. (I went thru my code many times and am quite convinced that I typed it all correctly). Other negatives were the light printed examples, missing elementary python features, the assumption that we could get all the ""packages"" to load into our editor, and the fact that some examples didn't run, or took additional web research to find ways around the problems. All in all, an OK book, and it was technically 7 books in one, but the last 4 ""books"" were about subjects that were quite specialised in focus.

"I read this immediately after Python Crash Course. I experimented with Python about 20 years ago and now I'm back with it (and far more serious about it). There are a lot of interesting little nuances to be aware of, especially as you continue to develop larger, more in-depth code. That's what this book is. You'll get to see some of the back-end of how Python interprets code so you can avoid certain errors that would probably drive you absolutely nuts in debugging (enough of that will happen with your programming experience, you don't want to add to it).The other benefit of this book is to learn how to write ""clean"", ""pythonic"" code. There are general conventions that professional software developers use that you will want to use from the beginning so you don't develop bad habits. If you've already done development, some of it may be a repeat for you and you'll simply skim past. If you're new to professional software development, you'll find this extremely helpful.Keep in mind that the book does run through numerous applications of Python. It's a versatile language. You may have very specific needs and certain parts of the book may not pertain to you. Also, if you're just writing short scripts, this may not necessarily be for you (although you may want to pick up good habits if you think you might expand your use of Python later).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python: Best Practices for Writing Clean Code

It also includes a valuable survey of commonly misused syntax, gotchas, efficiency, and some ""esoteric oddities"", Python tricks and lessons I have not seen in any other books.No Starch Press reliably puts out great books.

There is a lot of good material however it does not relate to beginners....,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python: Best Practices for Writing Clean Code
"“Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python” is an excellent follow up to “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”. This book covers a wide array of topics that share how to build a maintainable codebase in Python, how to be self-sufficient as a software engineer, and how to think empathetically when making subjective decisions about code. I would recommend giving this a read no matter where you are in your journey as a Python developer as I’m sure you will find something new or a valuable lesson.For some background on myself: I’ve been writing Python for about a decade now. I have created and maintained a number of Python projects personally and professionally, mentored junior engineers and interns, and taught introduction to computer science courses when I was in university.Chapter 1 starts it off on the right foot by explaining how to learn self-sufficiency in diagnosing errors and normalizes asking (and searching) for help when problems arise. While the tips for asking questions and providing sufficient context are framed for asking internet strangers for help, it’s also applicable when asking team members for help.While the book is framed for Python, there are excellent tips on how to use the command line and commonly used commands (ranging from cd and ls to git fundamentals), which is a universally useful skill in software engineering regardless of language. Al goes above and beyond by providing examples in multiple environments: Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.Throughout the book, Al reminds the reader that software development is a collaborative activity, whether it be with colleagues, friends, or internet strangers. Al takes on challenging (and sometimes contentious) topics— like code formatting, how to name variables and functions, and writing maintainable code—and provides modern solutions to them via tools like black and mypy. Supplementing the tools are stories and anecdotes that give way to the empathy used in the more subjective recommendations on writing maintainable software.Each chapter goes in-depth on explaining the specific topic and closes with a summary of the information as key takeaways. There are a number of important lessons scattered throughout every chapter backed by references to talks at PyCon or other helpful online resources where the reader can learn more.I appreciate Al’s precision when explaining specific components of code structure, such that someone new can learn the shared vocabulary and someone more experienced can be reminded of what the right words are, e.g. function vs method or properties vs attributes. Besides vocabulary, there are timeless lessons to be reminded of as well ranging from the technical to the subjective, like floating point number imprecision, asymptotic analysis, and explaining intent through comments.Something I was surprised to see not covered was project dependency management. While there is mention of pip, it would have been interesting to read Al’s recommendations to this Python problem. However, I know that the community is still trying to figure out where to standardize here, so perhaps it’s a bit too early to include in an educational book like this.Overall, “Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python” clearly explains a ton of programming concepts that apply both broadly to software development in any language and specifically to developing in Python. This book provides a solid next step for those that have started their journey with Python. I continue to recommend Automate the Boring Stuff with Python to newcomers to the language (or programming in general) and will be including this in those recommendations too.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python: Best Practices for Writing Clean Code
I read this book after working though automate the boring stuff with python.This was an awesome next book and helped me learn how to make my code more clean and well documented as well as learning about object oriented programming.This has helped me out when writing and reading code in my day job as a data analyst as a lot of ETL uses python,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python: Best Practices for Writing Clean Code
"I have started getting back into coding once again with Python and prior to that Java.  Until now the books i got were good but not great and failed to hold my interest.  I find this Python basics book to be so well written and interesting.  I just hit chapter 7 and unlike some reviews I have read I have seen nothing that was not covered in prior chapters.  Yes an Index would have been nice but anything i need to go back and refresh is readily available on Google.  For me so far it is mostly going back to look at syntax.  The review exercises and challenges get a bit more complex with each chapter which is great.  Finally what I really like is that their examples often intentionally produce errors and odd behaviors and then they give very good explanations as to why it is that way and what to watch out for.  I lied, that wasn't the final thing.  I also like the that they will teach you something and then say it is a bad practice to do that.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3
"While still reading the book and performing the exercises is good practice, I feel that the book is a good example of a practical introduction. Python 3 is a great programming language to learn, and the book has a fairly sufficient foundation for learning the language. Prior experience with Python 3 is not necessary, but understanding how a programming language works is a good primer to learn Python 3 and the book is structured like a timely exercise and practice format. Each topic is followed by a series of practical exercises, and doing these exercises helps with the knowledge gained. Some aspects of the language are covered that may be glossed over in a general explanation, but the book is patient with these aspects.Overall, I recommend this book for someone who wants to learn Python 3 in a few months (about two months on a continuous basis; otherwise, three to four months average for the whole book).",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3
"Why I like This BookI'm a fan of RealPython Tutorials and the instructors. I already had purchased the digital copy of this book. I know enough about Python now to not read from start to finish, but I'll refer to the book all the time. I needed a scraper to check on availability of equipment and a gym equipment site. Bingo! I start with the scraping using the Beautiful Soup parsing library. I can't say enough good things about this book for clarity of writing and examples that you can follow. This is a book written by instructors that know Python well rather than a programmer, and this shows in it's ease of learning.Why Did I Buy This Book?I tinker with Python for RaspBerry Pi, web scraping etc. I'd like to get into machine learning but can't commit the time yet.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3
"Fourth edition, no index.  !  What kind of robust learning/reference book has no index???

"So I bought the digital version of this book when it's still in pre-release. I bought this book when it's available in paper format. RealPython is the standard when it comes to Python learning. However, one page in the book is crooked and the page is also cut weird. It stands out from the rest of the pages when the book is closed. I'm not sure if it's an issue with just my book or it's the same for everyone. However, the whole page is still visible, so it does not interfere with reading, but it is a bother that the physical book is not perfect for how many revisions it's gone through during the pre-release digital versions.The page that's crooked and cut wrong in my book is on page 525 & 526.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3
"[This review was originally posted on April 5, 2021. It was updated on April 23, 2021. I am downgrading the book from three stars to two stars. Additional comments added on April 23 are added in square brackets.]I give this book a tepid thumbs-up. [Make that a hand gesture of ""Eh, so-so.]I used this book to come up to speed on Python from a dead stop. I have a good deal of experience with other languages (C/C++, Fortran, a bit of Perl, C shell, bash, IDL, maybe one or two others that I have dipped into and since forgotten.) I can't say whether the book is good or not for total programming beginners; it's been too long since I was in that state.For people like me:What's good: you can read through it fairly quickly and get an overview of the concepts, syntax, etc., associated with Python. The assumption here is that you are someone who prefers to get an overview from kicking back with a book rather than becoming glazed, leaning over your laptop even longer than you already are, jumping around between web pages.What's bad: (1) There is no index! (??!??) This is a very grave defect and is the biggest reason that I deducted stars [and that after having the book for a few weeks, I deducted another star]. It seriously limits the usefulness of the book after you have flipped through it. Since one does not get all the concepts clearly just from a quick read, one would wish to refer to it for memory refreshment when trying to get traction. The lack of an index frustrates that and is really a drag; you have to search for what you are looking for, based on the table of contents, recollection and page-flipping. It's tiresome. I wonder if it is a result of rushing to market, or just plain laziness. [This issue has been such a problem and a pain that I am going to look for another book that can serve as a beginner's reference.] (2) Having also watched several excellent Python tutorials from India on YouTube, I can say that this book reads like a screenplay for YouTube tutorials. I couldn't count the number of times the book says, ""Let's dive in!"" ""Let's get started!"" Etc.! Etc.! Etc.! (i.e., way too many exclamation points in general) [; very lazy and somewhat condescending writing.] This became annoying. A minor point, certainly; no stars were deducted for this.  [I would add that the book is mostly white space with relatively large print. The amount of information is not commensurate with the number of pages.] (3) Very heavy promotion of the RealPython web site. No stars deducted for this, either. Just irritating.Evidently RealPython got out first with a book on Python3, or at least got out with some linear combination of being early plus having effective SEO. [Either that, or I was lazy and in a hurry when shopping for a book.] If and when the O'Reilly ""Learning Python"" book (author: Mark Lutz) comes out for Python3, I will buy that. I find the O'Reilly books hold their value as practical references even as you learn whatever skill it is better and better and even as new versions of the particular technology come out - up to a point. This book that I am reviewing won't do that. (BTW, I actually own ""Learning Python"" for Python 2.3, copyright 2004. But it is too old to be reliable even for basics on Python3. For example, the print() syntax has changed. If *that* doesn't work, then you know a book is out of date!) [This was not meant to be a plug for O'Reilly, just a comparison to books - typical O'Reilly books, for example, but by no means only O'Reilly -  that are heftier in terms of information content and hold their value.]The bottom line: depending on who you are and what your purpose is, this book could be very helpful. [Somewhat helpful.] But be aware of its limitations as you type in your credit card number. [At this point I would recommend looking for something else. Yeah, this can be useful, especially if your employer is buying it, not you, but if it is your money, look for something better. The lack of an index is really a disaster.]",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3
"Seems like a well laid out book for introduction,  but not for an experienced developer.  I have many years of work in C and lower level languages,  but only python I've been exposed to from a few developers that are sneaking it into edges of a project.  This book covers a some very basic concepts but as I try to use the language I find the book seldom answers the question I'm looking for.  Further with any technical book I would expect an index to help track concepts down by keywords;  and this book has none.  Despite the book sitting near my keyboard,  looking at it is usually a waste of time, and I'm no better off than if I'd started with a google search anyway.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3
This is truly a programmers learning book. Broken from the shackles of traditional style learning systems and into a real learning environment. This is one of the best books for anyone who actually needs to learn and implement the material. The layout and structure feels like it was written by education scholars who actually understand how the mind adapts to concepts but most importantly have a pure understanding of python. It is articulated extremely well and this book is the best. The one and only reason it did not get five stars is the graphics could use a little improvement (trivial complaint... really) but I am sure this a product of the bargain price.

"I've bought a lot of introductory Python books, and this one I have to say is decidedly better than average, but by no means perfect. To be fair, Python is an absolutely vast subject to cover, and decisions have to be made in any introduction as to what to even mention, never mind address in any depth. This book does cover most of the items I would expect, but it is weak in some areas in my view. The object oriented programming chapter is terse, and doesn't even mention abstract classes as I recall. Coverage of lambda functions, first-class functions, closures and decorators (which some may consider intermediate topics) could be greatly improved. Solid working knowledge of these subject matters is needed in my view to be able to digest most ""serious"" code. Quite honestly, however, no introductory Python book I have purchased is what I would call stellar as a standalone volume, and I have had to piece together my working knowledge from various books and online courses.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages

Lubanovic is easy to read after going through a crash course in python. I really recommend pairing this book with: A Smarter Way to Learn Python by Mark Meyers. Meyers does a great job of introducing the material and keeps his chapters short. His book is really small and focuses more on syntax and proper formatting. Lubanovic goes further in-depth but he can be overwhelming at times especially if you do not have any prior experience with python. The first ten chapters are the basics and each chapter comes with examples for you to practice. It's a great book for students pursuing a degree in business analytics. Recommended!,4.0 out of 5 stars,Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages
"While there are good points made in the book and overall it is better than others that I have read, there are a couple of things that I do not like.The end of each chapter has a Things To Do exercise section. Unfortunately Lubanovic does not provide answers or sample solutions for them in the book; nor does he at the GitHub website that he references for code examples and exercises in the preface of the book. This is a FAIL for teaching beginners, who need to gauge their learning especially if they are hung up by the exercise. A question was asked about this on Github by another person, but the author has failed to respond or correct the concern expressed.Second issue for me is the rather lame 'jokes' he uses in a teaching book; perhaps for a more advanced book or reference or a classroom.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages

You’ll also be expected to set up your own targets for the scripts you write with very little explanations from the authors. In the grand scheme of things, these drawbacks (and overcoming them to get the examples to work) just reinforce the teaching of a “hacker” mindset in my opinion so it’s not that big a deal.

"A silly movie, with subpar special effects and lots of holes in the plot.  But it is a goofy and funny comedy.

The plane flying looked so fake.  Anyway, the plane crashes, releasing a 129' snake, genetically engineered by Biogene, to have the attributes of many different snakes.

There is a super real estate salesman and the scene where he is showing the house is full of double entendres.

"If you want to learn to code, don't hesitate and pick this book up now. Not only is the book well written, Python, the language the book is written about, is one of the most simple programming languages in the world. Being simple doesn't exactly make it weak either. Python is an incredibly powerful language. PCBs such as Rasberry Pi uses Python as its programming language. The book explains things well enough that they can be understood. However, older concepts are not rementioned, so taking notes is almost a necessity if you want to clearly read this book, which can be a little bit of a hassle. Some of the things you learn are:ValuesOperatorsVariablesFormatting StringsType CastingLists and TuplesDictionariesInteractive ProgramsSpecial CharactersCondition StatementsIf StatementsLoopsFunctionsModulesExternal FilesClassesObjectsPropertiesName ManglingSelfChild Classes & Objects: The Concept of InheritanceBuilt-In Python Functions for Objects.All of these are written clearly enough. I don't understand what others mean by ""not for beginners"". The concept of coding is quite complex. Unlike Scratch, we don't get a list of a syntax whose names tell us what they do. Explaining coding easily is a very difficult task. Somebody said that there were better Python coding books out there.

"Good:  Book is a very good and well organized way to get started with python.  Well written and easily understood.Bad: Kindle for Windows, gets worse with every implimentation.  Issues are quite simply bad window sizing logic that forces you to constantly readjust the size of your viewing page and window.  Does not auto size to the view screen properly on a tablet when you drag the bar to the top of the screen, with the top control bar  the page the close, collapse and full screen icons are off the screeen to the right, even though there is plenty of space for them - just bad coding..  Once you manually adjust the screen size, if you choose to view the notes or table of contents, it then resets the screen width to the overfill the screen again.  When you close these side panels, it doesn't restore the application width to what you previously spent a minuit or two setting it to properly fill the screen.  And worst of all, it automatically reduces the with of the reading pane by about an inch on each size, so you have to manually increase it to full width again.  This would be tolerable if it was only used to read short stories (like comic book length), but is a complete waste of time when one is employing a reference book.Final Grade:  Book- A+++, Kindle - F---------------------...

"This book is better than some of the Python books that claim quick knowledge of a computer language. Python is a powerful language and any claims to learning it in one day is a stretch. This book teaches the reader how to manipulate ""strings"", make simple computations, display results to the screen and gives you the very very fundamental feel of the language. If this is your first computer language than this is a good book for you and that is what I believe the author was trying to accomplish. However, loading the Python language interpreter can be a challenge maybe even frustrating since the links the author asks the reader to use didn't work on any of the computers I tried. The IDLE that is required does not get loaded with the authors link. I had to resort to loading a PYTHON Compiler which allowed me to create code, save code and execute code. On a positive note this book is better for a very first coding reader than other Python books I have reviewed. It is unlikely you will truly learn the language in one day but in a week you may have a decent handle on the very very basics.

"I just finished reading ""Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python"", and it's my new all-time favorite book for beginners who want to learn how to program. Al's outdone himself with this one. He does an incredible job of teaching the reader how to program in Python from scratch; whenever he comes to a concept that the reader may not be familiar with, he explains it clearly and thoroughly using simple English, and then demonstrates why the concept is useful.The writing in this book is tight, engaging, entertaining, and just seriously impressive, and the projects are super fun too. I particularly liked the Tic-Tac-Toe project: I thought it was really clever to have the reader implement an AI for one of their games so early on in the book, instead of burying something fun like that in a later chapter.I don't know if Al's gotten way better at writing over the past few years, or if he's gotten a great editor, or some combination of the two; but whatever the cause, this book really shines. When I read his book ""Making Games with Python & Pygame"" (published in 2012), I found that he sometimes explained concepts using frustratingly vague language, or introduced them in an order that bothered me, and I also noticed a few typos and bugs in that book's prose and code; I found basically zero such issues in ""Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python"".The only main thing I wish he'd change is that he uses mixedCase for his variable and function names, but snake_case is the naming standard in Python programs (documented in PEP8). It's not obvious to me why he prefers mixedCase, and this seems like something that shouldn't have survived to the fourth edition of this book. All in all, though, this is a problem I'm more than willing to overlook, given how otherwise excellent this book is.From now on, whenever a friend asks me what the best way is of learning to program, I'm going to point them directly to this book. Keep up the great work, Al!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 4th Edition"
"I'm a programmer and I'm teaching Python to my 7-year-old son. I decided to start with this book. It took us over a year to get through all the chapters. My son typed in all the code for each chapter without copying and pasting. After that I read the chapter to him, explaining the code. Then he had fun playing and modifying the games! My son's review is below:--------------------------Dear Mr. Sweigart, I really enjoyed the games in your book. There are many ways of modifying the games, like in the dodger game, you can make it so that every time your score gets to 1000, the baddies fall faster by 1. Also, you can change all the images and music to be like Zelda and you can make it 2 players. In Sounds and Images, you can make another food that makes you smaller. I like the improved hangman from chapter 9 because it has different levels of difficulty. Please continue to write more books on this topic.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 4th Edition"
"Its a good book but with a warning.  You learn a lot about logic and how to design your code/app.  He explains each section of the code to you in detail about what it is doing.  Right away he teaches you about debugging and how to use that to figure out how the code works.  I'd recommend the book for any adult, I would not recommend giving it to your 10 year old kid as they may lose interest pretty quick.  Some of the logic is definitely for someone with a bit of previous in school programming or past history of it.  I've done simple coding and took Java in college and I even had to really think and investigate on some of the logic.  I'd advise you to go over the book yourself before giving to your child to be able to help explain.  Another warning is some of the code is really long, lots of typing.  And I'd suggest downloading the source files as the code in the book isn't always correct to begin with so your app may not run.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 4th Edition"
"I'm using this book to teach programming to my 13 year old.  Like many kids his age, he's really into games and that interest has led him to want to learn how to program.  So, this book is a perfect lead in.  Basically, you copy the code for the game and then the author explains step-by-step what the code does.  While that is good, it is also incomplete.  As boring as it is, I feel like he needs to write his own smaller ""toy"" programs in order to really get the concepts.  I suppose I could (and will) make up for this by coming up with exercises to do this, but it would have been nice, if the author had included some himself.  So, I like a lot about this book, however, I feel it is incomplete without such exercises, and so will give it four stars instead of five.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 4th Edition"

"As a hermit crab owner, maintaining the ideal temperature in my 55-gallon tank has always been a challenge.

It's a reliable and worry-free option for keeping the temperature within a safe range.However, it's important to note that for a tank as large as 55 gallons, this heater alone may not be sufficient to maintain the desired temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit consistently. While the heater does a decent job, it's recommended to use it in conjunction with additional heating solutions to achieve optimal conditions.It's a reliable and safe option that effectively contributes to maintaining the appropriate temperature within the tank.

"Our snake pretty much lives on top of this heater. I put it close to the center (below) the glass tank. The snake built her nest right around it, and pretty much never comes out. I got a thermometer to put in the sand near the heater, so I know what temp it is on. DON'T turn it up all the way, or you will fry your animal. I turn it about 30 degrees from the max, and that is about 85-90 degrees. I put a little paint mark next to the dial, so I know where to put it. The one problem, related to that, is that the heat pad gets way hotter than many animals could take. Better to have a max of about 90, so there is no risk. Also, would be great if there was a digital temp. reading, but at this price point, that is not possible.

"The picture of the xl bowl looks comically small, but the dimensions listed seemed reasonable so I decided to order it. To my delight, the picture was wrong and it looks more like the L bowl but larger. A great bowl, makes good use of that pesky corner space, and holds a lot of water. I'm using for a 4.5 ft male boa constrictor and he has quite a bit of room to fully submerge and even sort of swim. Bigger boas will probably need a tote bin converted into a water bowl, honestly.

"I found the book itself to be motivational and well written, helping me, an old fart, experienced programmer, understand some of the pieces of agile programming with Python.Like many computer books on Kindle, the code isn't formatted well, but you just learn to work through that.My only complaint is Sale's choice of ""lettuce"" for BDD.  I tried to get lettuce working with Python 3 and ran into a number of problems, and the more I dug, the more I found that lettuce is problematic for a lot of people, especially when working with Python 3.  I am now moving on to ""behave"" for BDD, afraid that ""lettuce"" is a bit too much of a black hole. I also think that in his treatment of BDD (and even TDD), going with more of a ""Hello, World"" type of example at the beginning would have made things more understandable.All in all, though, it's a timely book, and takes the reader through important agile processes.  I gave it only three starts because of the code formatting, and the minor issues described above.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Testing Python: Applying Unit Testing, TDD, BDD and Acceptance Testing"
The writing is good. But there is little depth in lots of areas. The author should have either skipped these or written more. One example is the chapter on BDD. It aims to introduce and compare two BDD frameworks but neither is introduced in enough detail to provide a meaningful introduction much less a comparison. It's about like a QuickStart guide throughout many chapters. Unfortunately this is really hard to make useful. Many test environments require some customization and integrating multiple testing frameworks is usually not straight forward as many are written as if they exist in a vacuum.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Testing Python: Applying Unit Testing, TDD, BDD and Acceptance Testing"
"I really enjoyed this book. It covers some very useful tools needed to start testing software in Python. Gives a great overview of Nose and Py.Test.

He also covers performance testing (JMeter) and profiling (cProfile). Aspects related to cloud deployment/testing are mentioned together with concrete examples too.As a side note to the previous comments, the book doesn't cover functional testing and property-based testing.

"As a longtime fan of Monty Python, I was thrilled to get my hands on the 4K Ultra HD version of ""The Meaning of Life"". And let me tell you, it did not disappoint.First of all, the picture quality is outstanding. The vibrant colors and crisp details bring the absurdity of Monty Python's humor to life in a way that I've never seen before. Every scene, from the gross-out ""Mr. Creosote"" sketch to the bizarre ""Every Sperm is Sacred"" musical number, looks like it was shot yesterday.But the real star of the show is, of course, the comedy. ""The Meaning of Life"" is a series of sketches that explore everything from birth to death, with plenty of detours along the way. There are moments of biting satire, ridiculous slapstick, and even some surprisingly touching moments.As always, the Python troupe is on top form. The late Graham Chapman is particularly memorable as the host of the ""Galaxy Song"" sequence, while John Cleese delivers one of the funniest speeches in the history of cinema as the pompous headmaster in the ""Live Organ Transplants"" sketch.Of course, this being Monty Python, the humor isn't for everyone. If you're easily offended or put off by crude jokes and irreverent humor, ""The Meaning of Life"" probably isn't for you. But if you're a fan of absurdist comedy and British humor, you owe it to yourself to check this out.Overall, I can't recommend ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" on 4K Ultra HD enough. Whether you're a die-hard Python fan or just looking for a good laugh, this is one movie that's sure to leave you in stitches.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Meaning of Life
"...a Python fan since about twelve, I vividly remember this film coming out when I was thirteen or so.  I loved it.  It's great that it has not only held up but, like fine wine, it has gotten better with age.  Maybe Terry Gilliam's right when he says, in one of the commentaries, that, today, comedy's standard is so low that ""our crap seems good no.""  But it reveals their genius in so many ways.  It reveals a confidence they clearly didn't feel--as tho' they'd gotten their sea legs--in the first two efforts.  Though ""Brian"" is their supreme achievement, I have to say that this film must be placed ahead of ""Holy Grail""--which given its budget looks distincly like badly shot TV.  Hysterically funny, but the budget limits are are even more glaring in a high res medium like DVD.In ""Meaning of Life"" the entire cast are masters of the medium (something Cleese proved independently in ""A Fish Called Wanda"") and they use their skills, rising even to lyrical heights (Eric Idle's paen to the universe in ""Live Organ Transplants"").  And the effects are more hysterical twenty years later.This movie is also remarkable for the rather bitter satire of American pop culture.  Heretofore, the Python's had stayed within the classic tradition of British comedy--filled with whimsy and just plain silliness and the class structure.  American humor is generally either observational or political--and these days it almost entirely the latter.  Even the masters of observation, Goldberg and Carlin, have abandoned it for bitter political diatribes attacking former fans like myself in the basest terms because out political beliefs differ.And it follows, as it should, that the movie's best skits are the ones true to their tradition.  George Harrison once called Python the continuation of the Beatles (to the point of chipping in $8M for distribution and advertising for ""Brian""!).  And, especially in the all too brief Gilliam animations, this is completely accurate.  Without being at all derivative, they capture the whimisical sensibility the Beatles had updated and transformed and ran with it.One draw back is the rather low-rent 5.1 remix.  I've other films--e.g. the Godfather films--which are older than have far better jobs.  So don't expect much.  In fact, you might even consider using the 2CH option as the remixing engineer makes little use of the rear speakers.That gentle bitch aside, the deleted scenes are mixed (why on Earth Jones thought anyone would want to see more of Mr. Creosote is beyond me?) and clearly wisely hit the cutting room floor (especially the horrendously unfunny Martin Luther skit), but some the commentary by Jones and Gilliam--clearly done at different times and mixed--is interesting most especially for the bitterness of Gilliam's attitude.  It has been so on the two preceding films, but it's much more intense on this one.The brief interview segments shows the group rivalry is still a hot issue in the guys' psyches, nearly twenty years after Graham Chapman's tragic death ended the group; they are still bickering.  Gilliam's comments about Cleese are particularly acid; Cleese does he usual job of insulting nearly everyone.  He is returned the favor by the rest of the group, tho' Jones slyly does it with the most class and thus does it the best.  Cleese, after all, easily slips into insufferable.  Hence his brilliance as Basil Fawlty.A reluctant four star due only to the ****-poor 5.1 remix.  The studio, surprise, surprise, didn't want to spend any extra money getting a good one.The movie itself: 5 stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Meaning of Life

"""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" is a classic comedy film from the iconic comedy troupe Monty Python. The film is a series of skits and musical numbers that satirize various aspects of life and society, such as religion, sex, and death. The film is divided into seven segments, each dealing with a different stage of life.The humor in the film is irreverent, absurd, and often tasteless, but it is also clever, witty and highly original. The film features some of Monty Python's most memorable sketches, such as the ""Fish slap dance"" and the ""Catholic schoolboys"" skit. The musical numbers are also noteworthy, including the catchy ""Every Sperm is Sacred"" and ""The Galaxy Song.""The Meaning of Life is a film that is not for everyone, as it is not afraid to push boundaries and tackle taboo subjects. But for fans of Monty Python and for those who enjoy offbeat and unconventional comedy, it is a must-see. It is a movie that will make you laugh, think and question the meaning of life in a hilarious and irreverent way.Overall, ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" is a classic comedy film that has stood the test of time. It's a perfect blend of absurdity, satire and wit that will leave you in stitches and questioning the meaning of life itself.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Meaning of Life

You need to be in the right mood to watch this and there are a lot of hidden humors.  It's a classic but I'm afraid today's youth won't 'get' some of he humor.  Be sure you have the time to watch this as well.  Without distractions preferred.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Meaning of Life
"The film starts off strong and slowly decays and finishes of very sloppily. I think that was the intent of the pythons. This feature film in my opnion is probably the worst of the python films. There are scenes that you will never forget and some you wish you had never seen. Its tasteless and vulgar. Its sickening and sad. Its funny and its bad.Theres not much to say, if you dont like skit comedy or stage comedy then you wont like this.The film very effectivly goes into the ultimate futiliy of life and i think this would be a better title:"" Monty Pythons The Futility of Life."" its almost like the pythons condenced the book of eccleciasties from the Holy Bible.Now the bluray version is very clean and clear and safe to buy. there were no issues in the film with bad picture or sound. It all seems very well done. There are so many mindless features that any python fan would even consider too much. Much to much. I think thats the point. There is a commentary track for the lonely that reminds me of the pythons goofy cartoon sounds. Its funny in the context of watching the movie. Otherwise that commentary track makes absolutly no sense. Again i think thats the point. Ultimatly i think the pythons point of this film is to purposly waste your time to better understand the meaning of life. Im not being sarcastic i actually think its designed to waste your time.I would not recomend this film to anyone that has something better to do such as cleaning the house or shaving your face. the entertainment value is low. again i think the point is to piss you off that you wasted time and money. one of the pythons on the extra features is actually screaming about how much he hates this movie, and i think hes being serious. again this film is only for hard core python fans anyone else that is being introduced to the pythons would hate this film. if you want to introduce someone to the pythons start with the holy grail and follow up with life of brian. then ease them into the flying circus and then if they are hard core enough then they would like this. hahaha i think i understand this movie more after writing this. so i would give it 5 stars because i do hate it.""I really really hate this fiml!

You get the square picture for some later episodes, but they are not as good as the seemingly better filmed seasons #2 & #3.

"Nobody likes a High Definition remaster more than I do... Come to think of it, most people enjoy a High Definition remaster more than I do - but that's beside the point.When it comes to low-fi television productions, the use of state-of the art technology to improve the modern viewing experience (not to mention the cost and labor involved) is admirable. However, my eccentric preference for viewing such content is on my old tube television because it presents shot -or processed -on video content in a much more natural way than an HDTV.This is why I opted to purchase the DVD version of this series. While remastering the entire series in HD offered potential for improvement, that improvement was bound to be selectively significant, given that most of the show was shot on standard-def PAL video and the filmed content was shot on 16mm film. Down-converting it to DVD seemed like hardly a sin and a simpler option for purchase.While I'm happy to report that this compact box - containing every episode looking better than ever - is an obvious replacement to that A&E version I gave up on collecting years ago, I am disappointed to report that its 4:3 image is pillar-boxed in a 16:9 signal. If you never intend to view this on an old 4:3 monitor, you have nothing to worry about, but most major labels (even Criterion) would have made sure to transfer the content to the DVD in 4:3 form, knowing that it will play back correctly on any TV.To finally have the complete series despite the lack of certain legacy extras and specials, gives me a completist satisfaction. I'm only a little bummed that I'm limited to watching it on a flat-screen.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Flying Circus: The Complete Series [DVD]
"I just received this set, so I haven't yet had an abundance of time to peruse and sample it thoroughly.  But my first impression is that, for fans of this programme, this is the best thing to happen to comedy since Monty Python was originally conceived.First, from what little I've seen of the actual remastering thus far, it is stellar.  It is astounding how fantastically good the video looks now.  It is a revelation that must be seen to be believed.  All releases that came before pale in stark comparison, particularly the A&E discs.  (You can see samples of the restoration by doing an online search.)Second, the only ""editing"" that has been performed on this set is not to truncate material, but to restore episodes to their original intent and glory.  This means that most (if not all) jokes and visuals that were censored either before first airings or subsequent reruns have been located and restored.  The fact that these elements still exist is nothing short of miraculous, considering the BBC once considered wiping the broadcast tapes completely.  All thanks and gratitude go to the team at Network for the painstaking research and monumental effort it took to make this set a reality.Speaking of research, each series (season) comes with its own exclusive book obsessively detailing seemingly every minute that went into creating and filming that series.  Each is over 150 pages.Third, each series contains whatever respective outtakes could be located, the first time such material has been commercially released or seen (unless I'm mistaken).  Again, the fact that any elements of this nature have survived further cements this set as a holy grail, of sorts.Lastly, from an aesthetic perspective, my box arrived thoroughly undamaged.  It even came in its own sealed, plain brown shipping box with a MPFC barcode sticker affixed, thus limiting potential shipping damage.  So it is possible to receive one that survives relatively crash-free.If you have the 8-DVD set The Complete Series from Sony (unfortunately available only in PAL), I'd hold onto it as well.  The transfers on that set are not bad - though not comparable to the superior Network restoration - and use the set of masters as shown on American television (in the '80s, anyway) - i.e. differing edits than those found on the A&E set.  And if you're like me, you may occasionally feel nostalgic to see some sketches the way you remember.  For instance, I always thought the ""gangrene"" male voice overdub was intentional and enhanced the joke.  It's wonderful to finally hear it as intended, but I may eventually miss that silly edit - perhaps the only such alteration I will miss.If I have any knock on the set, it would be that I wish the two episodes produced for German television had been included.  True, they weren't part of the series proper, but it would have been a treat to see them get the same loving treatment.  Their absence, however, in no way detracts from the riches contained herein.  My guess is that Network has such a project in its future sights.  And who knows?  They may well discover even more long-missing material by then as well, and we may still be alive to see it.Cheers,Semprini",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Flying Circus: The Complete Series [DVD]
"The surreal humor of Monty Python arrived just at the right time. First broadcast in 1974 in Dallas (no less), and the 70’s were the perfect time for them; coming in the wake of Beatles films like “A Hard Day’s Night”, “Help”, “Yellow Submarine” and “Magical Mystery Tour” as well as a number of early Peter Sellars films provided the perfect introduction for their humor.The series picked up popularity slowly with their feature film “And Now For Something Completely Different” tanking at the box office in the U.S. but still finding a small and devoted audience. The four series (the fourth was shortened to six episodes and John Cleese had left by that point) may not have hit home runs with every episode but the brilliant ones jumped off the screen. Having said that,I doubt they could be done in our politically correct times. The show still has aged well with brilliant, surreal bits that are just plain bizarre.The Blu-Ray takes the original videotape sources Ithe studio footage was shot on video) and makes it look the best it ever has; it will never be a show that will look great on high def but this restoration improves the show and it probably didn’t even look this good to folks viewing it for the first time. Where possible the 16mm footage including the animation of Terry Gilliam has been restored from the source material that remains.The extras include some deleted or lost sketches, outtakes and a vintage 1974 interview. My only disappointments is that there aren’t any commentary tracks for some key episodes and the reunion shows that were done prior to this.The entire series is packaged in a large plastic case with multiple hubs over 7 discs. The booklet has a brief essay and the contents on each disc including episodes listed (they are also listed on the two sided cover insert).The series has aged remarkably well and, while they were beginning to run out of steam by the fourth season, there are still some terrific episodes. With Gilliam’s filmed animation segments rescanned into high def, the quality has improved.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Flying Circus: The Complete Series [DVD]

"Had the series on iTunes for some time and didn't like the quality, so I got this set.  Much better picture quality from the film scans.  Glad to see the 2"" quadruplex from the 60s held up after all these years.However, the back of the case indicates the aspect ratio is 1.33:1, or 4:3, which is the ratio of NTSC broadcast programs.  This collection pads the sides of the videos, so they are really 16:9/1.77:1 with black bars to fill in the space.

"It really looks great, only a few scenes from season 2 looked a little blurry, and the people who put this together even post a notice at the beginning of Mr. Neutron stating they were unable to clean some scenes up better. But overall, details and color are vastly improved. And the extras are worth it (the dvd is missing some, just recent promos so I’m not upset). I won’t gush, listen to the other 5 star reviewers if you’re a Python fan. If you can swing the blu ray, I think it would look even better, but the dvd is no slouch.

"My wife and I purchased this two or three months ago and just finished watching the remaining episodes about two weeks ago. We have always been fans of Monty Python, but had never seen the entire Flying Circus series in its entire run, so it was nice to have the opportunity (and unedited).First I should mention that I had some trepidation about ordering the Blu-ray set due to the comments about the packaging. Something may have changed, as the set we received did not come in the fancy box, but just a regular compact case with discography like most T.V. series are boxed in these days. The discs were pristine and undamaged.For a series that ran from 1969 to about 1974 the remastering/restoration was stunningly done. My hats off to the technicians who did that. Here and there some source material did not escape the ravages of time so well, but it was usual in a scene here or there and in some cases (maybe in the extras) there as a note about the low quality due to the original being lost or such. Overall excellently restored though.As for the content, if you are used to Monty Python humor, sight gags, etc. you will not be disappointed. I would say there is material here and there in certain episodes that some will find offensive by today's standards (religious knocks, nudity [think Benny Hill type stuff], racial knocks [some instances of black face], and more obscure ethic jokes/gags), but to be fair that was the times so to speak. It is what it was. Just a warning for those who might be offended.Otherwise, It was good to see ""the boys"" in form and we recognize other actors/actresses that appear in their later shows and films.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Flying Circus: The Complete Series [DVD]
"After much prevarication I purchased the ""Norwegian edition"" box set of MPFC. It works FLAWLESSLY in my generic United States bluray player.What's more important however, is the profoundly stunning quality of the video and audio. I'd read that they had gone back to the original film and video sources and converted them into high-def; what I wasn't prepared for, however, was how great the picture would actually look. Even the elements that were shot on late 1960's video format are digitized, cleaned up, and upconverted so flawlessly that they actually look like live TV. I haven't been able to detect any motion blur, any artifacting, or anything of the sort. I am a big Criterion fan and I haven't even seen them do as good a job with 50+ year old elements as this.One of the other main draws is that each of these sketches are presented in their full, unedited form - for the first time EVER. Even edits that were made before the originaly 1960s/1970s broadcasts - and which remained that way into every video release - are fully restored here. It's amazing the tiny treasures you will find rewatching your favorite sketches.Lastly it deserves to be said that each season box set comes with a densely-packed book of fascinating information. This isn't just a small booklet with a few pages of bland commentary; no, each of these are lengthy and detailed and highly entertaining treatises that provide a lot of information that even a lifelong fan like myself didn't know before.I was lucky, in reading the reviews, that my box set arrived with no damage to the flimsy cardboard packaging. I can't dispute the pictures that are shown in these reviews, but I do have to say that mine arrived with no damage. I'm not sure if they've improved the packaging since the initial complaints, but my package seemed sturdy and without risk of damage.In any case - if you live in the US with a generic bluray player, rest assured, this ""norwegian box set"" will work on your player and TV - and you will not regret the purchase. This is the best, and most definitive, and final version of MPFC that one could ever hope for.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Flying Circus: The Complete Series [DVD]

"The book Python Workshop 2nd edition is an impressive and detailed technical book that examines the Python programming language, the libraries, and various applications of Python. The book is comprehensive about Python up to version 3.11 and examines some of the future features of Python.The book is organized into thirteen chapters and is organized into roughly three sections. The first section is about Python, the programming language, the libraries, the environment, data structures, executing Python, and writing object-oriented Python. The first section is approximately six chapters of the book. The second section is the next six chapters and explores applications of Python with different topics. Some advanced topics, and then more specific ones such as data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning. The last chapter is also the third section of material and covers the new features of Python up to version release 3.11. The last section discusses the evolution of Python through each version, and the new features added to Python.Many areas of Python are covered, discussed, and examined; the book touches upon such topics as machine learning, data analytics, software development, and others. The use of programming exercises, approximately 170 exercises are provided, to implement and illustrate Python concepts in code. The Python source code solutions are online at GitHub so available to “see for yourself” how to complete an example programming exercise.The general scope, wide coverage of topics, and comprehensive nature of the book that make it an excellent technical book are also the only problem. There are many topics covered about Python and its application of Python--and the amount of material, and concepts can be daunting. For someone new to Python this book is a massive amount of information, so is better suited for a reader with some Python programming experience.This book is an excellent source for someone who has some Python programming experience and knowledge and wants to pursue learning more by doing in the various areas examined in the text. A teacher would find this book very useful and suitable for teaching pupils about Python programming, and then some areas of application.Yet for a beginner to Python programming, this book can be a challenge, as it does not focus on Python programming exclusively as a programming language, and has a myriad of example applications. The book also is suitable and useful as a Python reference for features of Python and examples to demonstrate how to use a particular feature.Overall Python Workshop 2nd edition is an excellent text, comprehensive in scope and covering many areas. The book is suitable for a classroom, or self-paced learning text for an experienced Python developer; yet the book is intimidating and daunting from the amount of material and topics covered--not for a newbie programmer learning Python on their own outside the structure of a classroom.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Python Workshop: Write Python code to solve challenging real-world problems, 2nd Edition"
"Learning Python can be a blocker to success with DevSecOps.  “The Python Workshop, 2nd ed” (Packt, 2022) by Corey Wade, Mario Corchero Jimenez, Andrew Bird, Dr. Lau Cher Han, and Graham Lee covers every part of Python a new user could possibly hope to know.  The book provides extensive code samples, small exercises to work through, and more detailed activities to explore coding options.  Starting with basic Python fundamentals, the book works through advanced implementation with libraries and ends with thoughts about implementing ML structures, including data analytics.  Again, anything a Python user could want, either from a new start point or a reference manual to keep on the desk.  Recommend for anyone using Python. No sections are provided in the reference; instead, chapters are listed from 1-13 with gradually advancing topics.  The first four chapters cover the basics of developing in Python, the next five are about software development and the last four advanced data analytics.  Starting with the fundamentals, the frame introduces Jupyter Notebook as one of the ways to sequentially implement Python.  The standards for basic coding, assigning variables, using variables, and developing conditional statements are all included.  These first four sections include 70 exercises and 13 activities to test individual abilities and ensure concepts are understood. The middle sections are the meat of Python expressions.  Classes, methods, and modules are all covered as well as how to import previous Python libraries from others to shortcut code.  Also included is an excellent section on coding collaboratively through using Git and merge requests.  Most texts skip this function, and the inclusion is a strong addition to the overall value.  The authors briefly touch on other Python forms, such as Cython for using C+ wrappers and PyPy for Just-in-Time compilation through Python.  Another 58 exercises are included, and ten more activities to ensure all the presented topics continue to be understood. The last section touches on the cutting edge of Python development by introducing machine learning and data analytics topics.  The text references pandas and NumPy as the primary libraries to access these tools and provides a number of samples to best implement.  Different machine-learning types like K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests and naive Bayes are all presented and explained as methods to reach one’s ML goals.  One strong point in reference books is this ability to not just stop at the basics but show the most advanced options possible.  In personal development work, my company offers the toolbox, the blueprints to use the toolbox, and then shows what our artists can deliver with that toolbox.  This reference follows a similar path.  This last section offers 41 exercises and four activities to practice ML skills.  Though offering a clear path from beginning to end, the book moves fast.  Covering all this material in an individual text is a lot, and the reader will most likely be using Stack Overflow and community groups at points if they become stuck on the various activities.  An excellent reference, this book could easily have been split into 3 manuals of equivalent length to really dig into the various pieces.  However, this does not detract from the book’s value as an initial reference or a continuing reference to Python’s capabilities.  Overall,  “The Python Workshop, 2nd ed” (Packt, 2022) is an excellent reference and one I am happily including in the stack of manuals on my desk.  I even found using the exercises and activities a good refresher for my own skills.  Whether one is just starting their Python coding journey or looking for a refresher, I recommend purchasing and frequently referencing this work for anyone currently involved with Python at any level or just hoping to get started with this great language.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Python Workshop: Write Python code to solve challenging real-world problems, 2nd Edition"

"As an engineer who has worked with Python for various projects over the past few years, this book is a phenomenal resource for those looking to get started in Python. It is suitable for readers who have never programmed before, as well as those who have programmed in other languages but are looking to get into Python.The book starts from first principles in Python, going over basic syntax and features of Python as well as data structures before getting into various algorithms and libraries (such as pandas and NumPy) available for the language. The later chapters get into some exciting applications of Python to data analysis, machine learning, and more. The chapters have plenty of examples and exercises that allow readers to test their understanding throughout.While the book is best suited for beginners, there is still plenty of great content for those who have worked with Python before. The chapters on Python applications such as machine learning and deep learning provide a depth of knowledge for those who are less familiar with those fields such as myself. Overall, this book is a great place to get started for those looking to jump into the world of Python programming!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Python Workshop: Write Python code to solve challenging real-world problems, 2nd Edition"

"This is a great book for the intermediate to advanced python programmer who wants to take the elegance of the language to the next level (and write optimized, coherent and maintainable code).It is not a good introductory text, however. I recommend a new python programmer should start with a tutorial or two before delving into the meat of this book. It is a great way to hone python skills while illustrating the power of Python datatypes and comprehensions. You will get to see actual python one-liners do magical things thanks to the dedication of the python team in making language constructs and power both accessible and readable.

Having said that, the book does provide some learning value.The good...* with the constraint of only using a single line of code, you need to understand exactly how the syntax works, to get the desired results.* the book covers many areas to show the applicability of the approach. For example quickly moving onto Numpy. this can move you out of your comfort zone to try new things.The Bad...* The one liners are really hard to read and digest.

"Although this wasn't a standout in terms of originality, I still give it a high rating because it is so imaginative. Imagine - Americans and Russians actually working together (as in, on the same team) on something (wow)! Something like this will probably only happen in far-fetched movies like this one. We (Americans) competed with them with the Moon landings, we were at war with them (for world dominance) for almost half a century, and now we are at war with them again for (supposedly) meddling in our elections. I find it somewhat sad to realize (as this movie made me think about) that it probably would take something very out of left field (like trying to capture an 85-foot snake) to unite the US and Russia in a common noble cause. Nonetheless it was interesting to explore the idea that, maybe someday, the two countries can unite and fight for a common cause.Hopefully that won't involve going after mega-giant snakes, though!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python 2
"First thoughts...Nicely done. But...not as good as the first one. Here's the breakdown.1.  Directing--Very good. I liked the kind of quick-cut filmmaking from Lee McConnell.2.  Script--Good writing from Jeff Rank. There is some cheesy dialogue, but it's not that bad.3.  Acting--You've got William Zabka back, and he's my favorite character in this movie and the first one.Now for the content review.Rated R for language and creature violence.1.  Sex/Nudity=0/10.2.  Violence/Gore=4/10. It's not as violent as the first one but the snakes still eat quite a few people.3.  Language=8/10.

"I bought this film on Amazon with the first Python and bought blindly. This film is not really bad as it is boring. The movie is about a plane crashing somewhat close to the first one. I watched this right after I watched the first Python and was disappointed. The cast of the film is nowhere close as good as the first one with Billy Zabka returning in it(this time a bad guy) but still the same charecter as the first one. The two main good guys are played by Dana Ashbrook and Simmone Jade McKinnon. If you do not watch Syfy original movies or direct to DVD films you will not know who these people are but since I watch b movies I know who they are. Once again the cast fails in bad acting and no name actors.The films CGI is a little better than the first one but CGI no matter what the budget is the CGI gets better by the year and this being made two years later than the first one. With the first one it kept me in it and I was not bored but this one is very boring and kept me looking at the time on the DVD player for how much time is left. That is the negative of the film and here goes the positive: the attacks or somewhat good and that's about it. I paid $5 for it and wished I bought another DVD but I originally bought this because I bought Boa vs Python in a 4 film collection and decided to collect the whole series including Boa, Python, and this film which I have completed.My advice do not buy or do not rent on Netflix unless you want to be bored.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python 2
"Big snake in a little box.  They are sent to retrieve a monstrous python (military experiment) that seemed to have been contained in a little box.  The CGI is what one would expect from a low budget movie.  The movie is entertaining, but there are a lot of plot holes.  For instance, the woman has been blinded, but she is the only one who can fit in the ventilation duct so naturally they give her a flashlight.  And once out of the vent, she is running around fine.  The snake growls, roars and hisses, but actually the less one sees of the snake, the better.  And suddenly there are more than one snake.  The ending just seemed to be an excuse to use lots and lots of GCI explosions.  Nothing special about the movie, which takes place mainly at the base where the snake box is taken after the plane carrying it crashed.  And naturally, told not to open the box, they have to open the box.  Bad idea.  Remarkably tame for this type of movie, without copious gallons of blood.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python 2

buy this book,5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Cybersecurity: Using Python for Cyber Offense and Defense
"I would give this book 2-1/2 stars, if Amazon would let me give half-stars.  It's not ""bad"", it's just focused almost exclusively on cybersecurity *for* *Microsoft* *Windows* systems, and how each example might map back to an attacker goal/technique denoted within the MITRE ATT&CK framework (also, not ""bad"", per se).Python is PLATFORM INDEPENDENT, yet the examples from this book focus on using Python within the Windows execution environment, often requiring various Windows facilities (WMI, autorun, the Windows registry, Windows logging, and the like) that do not exist on Linux systems.  This makes many of the examples irrelevant, as Linux underpins the entire Internet.Chapter 5 - ""Performing Privilege Escalation"" does not demonstrate this topic. It does show how you could inject malicious Python libraries somewhere within your own PYTHONPATH, but does not talk about how this could be used to achieve privilege escalation.Having said all of that, the examples that are provided would seem to work in a Windows environment, and are designed to attack and defend a Windows system.  The book is rather short, but each example seems to deliver on its goal of demonstrating a Windows-based attack and defense using Python - mostly by running a Python library and (very brief/limited) script from within that same Windows system.  (This is know as running an ""agent"" on a protected/targeted device.)  In summation, the book does provide value, but that value is rather lean, Microsoft-Windows centric, agent-based, and couched against definitions laid out by the MITRE Corporation's ""ATT&CK framework"".  Perhaps renaming this book would help to better set the expectations of prospective buyers.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Cybersecurity: Using Python for Cyber Offense and Defense

"I already have the print version of this book, and like it a lot. It's full of very instructive examples that you can study and learn from.I bought the Kindle edition in January 2019 wondering if it had a table of contents, as some people said, no, it didn't.First of all, I wouldn't even try to read the Kindle edition on my Kindle Paperwhite, since the screen is too small and the contrast is not great. Instead, I read it on the Kindle for PC Windows program, and the book is easy to read, including the code examples (this is on a 24"" monitor).I can report that when read on the Kindle PC program, the inline text in the main window does not include a text version of the table of contents. However, on the left side of the Kindle PC program, if you click the icon for ""table of contents"", a full clickable and expandable table of contents appears in a narrow window to the left of the main text window. This is fully usable as a table of contents, and makes for very easy browsing. There is also a full clickable index at the end of the main body of text. The page numbers in my Kindle edition correspond exactly with the page numbers in my printed version. Another Kindle for PC plus: the example code uses color for syntax highlighting, which is nice.Edit: Upon further browsing, if you go to the very end of the main text window, there is a clickable text version of the table of contents. It's not so useful at the very end of the document - the left-side table of contents window is much more convenient.

"Python Cookbook goes in depth on a variety of different Python topics. Each section is similar to a question that might be asked on Stack Overflow. The recipes range in difficulty from easy to advanced metaprogramming.One particular recipe that I liked was 9.1 on how to time a function. When I am using Python I often need to time the code, and usually I need to look up how to do it. This example created a decorator function for timing. It makes it so that you can just put @timethis on top of a function and see how long it takes to execute. I appreciated how elegant this solution was as opposed to the way I was implementing it.Most examples are self contained and all the code examples that I tried worked. Additionally, there is a GitHub that the authors created which provides all the code for the examples if you do not want type it yourself. The examples themselves were applied to real world problems; I could see how the recipe was used clearly. When the authors felt they could not provide an entire solution in the text, they point the correct place to visit online.The range in topics was impressive. I found the most challenging chapters to be 9, 12, and 15 which were on metaprogramming, concurrency, and C Extensions. At the beginning of the book the recipes cover topics you would expect like data structures and algorithms, strings, and generators. I found myself surprised that I had not seen a lot of the techniques and solutions before. They were well crafted solutions, and I appreciated how much time and detail the authors must have spent to gather the information.This is a great reference to have by your side when programming in Python.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Cookbook, Third Edition"
"Honestly, the best book on Python I’ve seen (4 years experience, myself). David Beazley is hands down my favorite “instructor,” and I’m re-purchasing the book because I destroyed my old one from highlighting/writing etc all over it.What’s great are the little explanations of specific stuff and the details that provide a great background-info (like when you’d want to specifically use type.__init__ and not type.__new__ in a metaclass,), and will give full examples, even to a “ridiculous” end to show how it can be done (ie super complicated single meta programming call vs piecemeal with decorators), but since it does the same thing it helps to illustrate that there’s usually an alternative way to do a very specific thing if you need it.P.S. check out the authors webpage as he has pdf and slides of great info/resources. It’s just as useful (Though not as broad) as the book.P.P.S. if you’re looking at other books, I don’t recommend the “essential python reference.” You’d be just as good with the general docs.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Cookbook, Third Edition"
"The Active State repository of Python recipes includes many gems, but as the Authors observe in their preference: ""most of these recipes are steeped in history and the past"".  I'd add that the signal to noise ratio seems to be decreasing.  The most prolific contributors (with the exception of Raymond Hettinger) have posted trivial examples rather than recipes.  This book includes some simple examples too, but it's always in the context of a larger message.  Excellent content and advice without the chaff.I just bought this today.  Unlike some early technical Kindle books I've purchased, the formatting is excellent.  Kudos to the authors and publisher.  But when I first browsed the content with Kindle-Android on my 7"" tablet (Nexus), I still found it frustrating to read.  Next, I tried my laptop with a 14"" screen - better.  And then tried it on my PC with a large monitor and found reading and jumping around the content much more productive and pleasurable.  Switched back to the tablet, I changed the text settings to minimums for font size, margin size, line spacing and entered full-screen mode.  Result: much better!  That said, I still found the much larger screen area on my PC monitor preferable.Bottom Line: Buy this for great Python 3.3 code and advice in a flexible format.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Cookbook, Third Edition"
"Having read some humdrum works in the Cookbook series, my expectations were not very high. However, I soon discovered that this book is in a different league.When he discusses a problem, Beazley gives you his favorite solution. He also presents alternatives, discusses pros and cons, and calls your attention to subtle details in the solution --- leaving you with a feeling of having learned something of value.But that's only the beginning. It's hard to describe the pleasure of reading some of the solutions in the Iterators and Generators section, for instance. Actually, I take that back. The pleasure is the same kind as what you may have felt when you first came upon ideas in books such as Bentley's Programming Pearls, way back when.I hadn't felt that excited about a programming book in a long time.

"Beazley has a 'deeply clueful' understanding of Python.  What you see in this book is not just how to get things done, but how to do it in the 'Pythonic' fashion.  It shows you how to work with the language, not just implementing it with generic 'this will work in any language' constructs.This book has showed me how to do a lot of new things, and even if I already knew how to do something, now I know how to do it better, faster, cleaner, or more robustly.The book is also well written.  Finding the material, and reading through the narratives for particular snippets of code is very clear, there's rarely a need to go back to re-read anything, ideas are conveyed simply but effectively.I own a bunch of other Python books, but they all have a time and place in your learning process.

It does not motivate these tasks, you need to know what you're looking for, but even a brief read-through can shine light on things you never thought were possible in the standard library.5 stars for those wanting to understand the under-the-hood mechanics of python as well as mad-scientists testing their limits. 2-stars for beginners, as the first few chapters might be useful, but will largely go over the heads of those just getting started.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Cookbook, Third Edition"

I thought at first that the coverage levels were uneven - some of the data structures discussion could easily be grasped by a beginner but the Class recipes were very deficit to comprehend.  That may be more indicative of indicating where I'm not up to speed in my Python than anything to do with the writing.  The text by itself is pleasant and non-academic with clear explanations.  There is, admittedly, a lot in the book that is currently well beyond my understanding (I'm a retired programmer but never worked in most of the areas covered), so the book additionally has provided a challenge to learn from someone who obviously knows what they're doing.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Cookbook, Third Edition"

The examples are pretty good and I started to understand the syntax and how to read Python.  While this book is not all encompassing, it allowed me to make sense of commands I could look up on the internet.  There was one area I thought was lacking, the explanation of 'classes'.  It was a topic covered in the book but for myself, I couldn't comprehend was was being said.

"Before buying this book I heard about LPTHW and the ""controversy"" around...but obviously this is the internet and everyone is entitled say whatever they want so I didnt took them seriously.Before reading this book, I've read some C++ concepts in the past (couples of years before) but they were simple as: types, functions, statements.. so nothing complicated, but I went thru this book with a tiny bit of knowledge..At the beginning of the book I was amazed at how much fun I has having and how much better I was starting to understand those concepts (that I was already familiar with).The way the book is structured its extremely good: making your hands dirty immediately it's really the right thing to do for a beginner.It may be obvious for some one but wasn't for me, the fact that you should type everything you see and make it work on your own, and then read and check what is happening. Then type again and again and eventually, even if you don't REALLY understand the DEEPER MEANING of everything, you are still a step further to getting closer.So everything was going fine and I was eager to go to the next lesson...Till chapter 43 when he introduces the Class/Object..I honestly went back on it a couple of times but every time I felt that there was something different... somethings has changed from before... there was no more fun, no more understanding.. but just: DO IT AS I DO AND SHUT UP.There was little room for exploration as he presented a semi-empty script with empty classes  that you should fill as he would... oh and yea he just introduced you to what a class is like.. so good luck with that.You pass from ITS A, HAS A type of explanation to complete an already started script of several different classes with subclasses and inherits.. wtf? I've felt like I jumped 2 chapters...It was challenging? absolutely but it wasn't fun... it wasn't discovering new things... it was desperation of trying to solve this exercises because you know that classes are an important topic...And from there, it just got worst...At chapter 47 you are introduced to an another fundamental topic: TESTS.So as usual you start typing and typing and installing modules, you will get excited of all of this new stuff you will learn about... but you will be WRONG... because as soon as you finish he says:GO ON INTERNET AND FIND OUT HOW TO USE AND INSTALL EVERYTHING YOU JUST DID.....W.T.F... it took me a day to find out in the nose manual that their syntax was the same as unittest but just spelled with the format snake_case...As a beginner, and as I have never seen what an test/assert_equal is, I WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED A BIT OF EXPLANATION before sending me online..I had to go online and search for OTHER people tutorial about something that I was suppose to learn in this book... WTF AGAIN...And from here honestly I just lost interest... he doesn't show anymore the ""what you should"" see section so you are left on your own... If you don't understand: too bad... If you do understand but misunderstand also too bad... For me was harder trying to understand what HE will have me to do rather than the code itself...At the end of the book you will do automatic tests of his text game and deploy it online so he introduces some HTML concepts but honestly I just didn't care anymore and never finished.. and here brings me the major flaw about zed in my opinion.He states at the beginning that he doesn't want you to teach everything, but he wants you to be autonomous and be able to understand what to search bla bla... Ok! its a good mentality! But there is a problem.. programming concepts are so deep and so many (even for a subject alone).. that you NEED at least something information to start and only then LEAVE THE REST TO YOU if you want more info...Again: if I have to leave the beginner's book to search other tutorials for beginners to understand what has written in my beginner's book... I think that the book failed to do part of his job...I then IMMEDIATELY went to PYTHON CRASH COURSE and things just pop out like flowers in spring... and it was because of how zed open my view of how to take a programming book..So I recommend this book even despite the BIG disappointment of the last chapters, because I truly think that this book teaches you the discipline that you will absolutely need to start every other book.. but be aware you will not become a expert programmer after just this book... buy this together with PYTHON CRASH COURSE and think of them as one lesson.. typing (LPTHW) and understanding (PCC)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series)

So that should tell you a bit about who i am and what I am seeking. I bought the book knowing that the title says ""the hard way "" in it.. Reading some of the book and looking at reviews I thought this is something I can handle.I think the book is excellent up to a certain point and then goes off the deep end. What I mean by this is that it starts out at a basic level teaching the reader how to install python and also how to write simple functions and such. great stuff and I like the approach. Then.. all of a sudden it jumps into OOP and starts talking about things I cannot follow. I did the exerecises and read over and over and still find it jumping from entry level to very advanced stuff. so.. given the context of the subject matter, the title indicates this is done the ""hard way"" but in the title there is also a phase that indicates this is a very simple introduction to the world of computers and code.. I think when we write or sell and instruction book, we need to stay at the level it is intended and consider the buyer and the level of his skills and STICK with that concept. I seriously doubt you can write a book which has the intent of teaching Python from the ground up and then jump off into OOP. I would have preferred to kept going with basic programming and then bought a more advanced book when I felt the need. Sorry.. half the book is a waste of my time. I was going to give this rating a 1 but consider the good value in the first half of the book. I'll keep it as a reference. But.. it could have been done differently.***************************I added some more comments here.. I went back to the book to redo the lessons.. I do find the manner of typing all the code very helpful and intuitive. it works to reinforce the material. I changed the review to 4 stars.. I still feel the section on OOP is out of context.. I'm keeping this book as a good reference place to actually write code and practice writing",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series)
"Good book but it assumes some expertise, that seems to run contrary to a beginner book, however you were warned that it’s the hard way. I appreciate the humor, the repetition, and the exercises. If you need help setting up anything on your Mac or pc, you will have to go online and learn every outdated way to do it the wrong way and you will learn to do it the right way because the installation is always changing and everything is wrong.

"It's a decent book. I also read his previous version with python2, however its all or more the same. He defines the ""hard way"" as typing things in yourself, which I actually like. However outside of this, he leaves a lot of guessing and doesn't do the best job at explaining things. Hell, in exercise 40 he even states that ""Keep in mind that I’m giving you a slightly inaccurate idea of how these work so that you can start to build up an understanding of classes "". So he really takes a roundabout way into topics, and leaves a lot of open ended things from the students perspective. You will do many exercises without explanation and the reassurance that ""we will explain this later, don't worry, but just type in the code and trust me"".Wouldn't recommend this book to most learners, there are better options out there.

"Shaw's ""hard way"" is the way that I learned to code as an 8-year-old in the early '90s, and the way that my dad learned to code in the '70s. It means that you type in code, character-by-character, from what is printed in the book, not necessarily fully understanding what it's going to do or why. Then, once you have it working, there is an explanation of how the code works. Basically rote memorization drills paired with learning the associated concepts. It can be tedious at times, but it works well.This book is absolutely appropriate for someone with no coding experience. Someone who has learned a language before will probably already be familiar with many of the concepts, but it's still ok if you are willing to tolerate a little bit that.The drawback for me is that a big portion of the book has you writing small Zork-style games in order to practice the skills that you're learning. It's just not something that I am interested in at all, and I've had a little bit of trouble pushing my way through that stuff.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series)
"I've tried multiple tutorials from multiple sources (Udemy, Lynda, Tuts+, Codecademy, YouTube, etc.), but none of them compare to the LP3THW method.  You'll get your hands dirty right away by diving straight into the exercises from the very beginning.  You're not bogged down with a ton of theory up front.  Instead the theory is gradually revealed as you progress through each exercise.  Unfortunately there is one down side, if you want the accompanying videos, you will still need to purchase directly from his website.  The Kindle version doesn't provide access to any of the online videos.  I know many reviewers wrote negative reviews because of this, but it's how Zed has things set up.  When you purchase LP3THW directly from Zed's website, you will be able to get any and all updates related to that purchase, including any new videos.  And for those who seem to think Zed has a bad attitude when it comes to teaching, they fail to understand that he clearly states in one of his lessons, it's his goal to ensure that his students can move forward into a PROGRAMMING environment without the need of his ongoing help.

If this will be the only resource you have then it is not a good way to learn Python. It requires lots of supplementation even when using the accompanying videos on the publisher's website. This book is good for getting a feel for coding the extremely simple stuff but doesn't place emphasis on what you should be calling things except in a few fringe cases. Once you get to exercise 43 the book is basically useless because it expects you to already be able to code object-oriented programming (OOP) somehow but also has barely even explained it.As a beginner in order to complete the exercise in the manner prescribed in the book you will have to look up tons of external material in order to learn OOP which effectively makes the book pointless at that point since it isn't teaching you anything.It really feels like there were supposed to be more exercises before exercise 43 but constraints or laziness prevented the author from adding them.That said for an absolute beginner it is fine from exercise 1 - 42 as long as you supplement with outside material such as youtube videos in order to actually learn what the book is trying to teach you.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series)
"I don't like how often the book says ""Look {this} up online."" If this is going to be a teaching method in the book, they could at least point me toward a site that provides reliable, up to date information (Yes, I know this is difficult in print because websites change). I bought this book to teach me the material, not to tell me to look things up online. They could give a brief definition, so that at least when you look something up online you can verify that the online source agrees with the book, and is just providing more detail.The author also uses built in python methods without explaining what they are. I'm coming from c++, where generally if a function is called it is explicitly written somewhere, so I was searching back through the book looking to see if it was written somewhere I missed. I finally looked it up online. Since the author likes to use ""Look this up online,"" as a teaching method, ""Look up {this} built in python method"" online would have been helpful.Other than what I consider unacceptable missing information, I like the style of the book and it is very easy to understand and follow.

"There are plenty of good reviews here and most of them (if not all) are going to be from students and faculty.  The content in the academy published books is so basic, you should get the free kindle version or search online resources such as w3schools and youtube for alternate content (before paying for anything from TTA).If you are considering a coding bootcamp (such as the academy), you should know that this isn't a formal classroom environment with teachers.  You will pay thousands and you'll only learn the basics of python and/or C#.  By comparison, you can pay $500 for oreilly's 1 year subscription and get original content and access to advanced content, even certification prep exams.  The academy is not original or unique.  And much of their content is not theirs.  They will refer you out to w3schools.  They'll use others' videos.  And even when the day comes that they can claim all content as their own, it will be unoriginal and still over-priced.  Their job placement is informational for resume building and interview training, but you'll be doing your own job hunting throughout your time with the academy.  They don't guarantee a job.Coding is all about self-confidence in your ability and employers appreciate self-taught go-getters.  So if you're motivated enough (and willing to pay thousands) for a bootcamp, you owe it to yourself to shop around.  Look into oreilly, Linkedin learning, codeoregon (teamtreehouse) or other such platforms where you'll learn beyond the basics.

"I'm a CS professor, and I chose this for my course in Deep Learning last term.  Overall I am happy with the book, and will use it again.  It rates 5 (or even 6!) stars for being an approachable introduction to Deep Learning, using the author's excellent Keras library to allow beginners to do remarkable work.  My own class of undergrads was building DLNN models to do sophisticated image recognition tasks after just a few weeks.So, why the four stars?  Because the book is rather ""paint by the numbers"". The presentation is filled with ""Now you'll do this.."" followed by working blocks of code for the student to enter and run.  But there are no exercises, code or mathematical.  Even the standard backpropagation algorithm is only qualitatively described -- nice pictures of gradient descent in 2 dimensions, but no hard equations.  (After all, Keras does it all for you, right?)  And as the book ventures into more advanced areas like GANs, VAEs, etc the presentation is increasingly high-level and nonmathematical, providing only a feel for the topics without deep comprehension.

"If the paperback book I received didn't look and feel like an illegal physical copy or a rather poor quality physical product, I'd be giving it 5 stars, so 3 stars here is for the crappy production quality and not for the content.  I borrowed this paperback book from our public library and really liked it.  The content is great, and it's a useful tool to get up and started with machine learning -- IF -- you already know how to write code in Python.  If you aren't at least familiar with some Python and you aren't going to bother making an effort to learn more, then get a different book.  Good luck finding one as good.Since I really liked the copy I borrowed from the library, and prefer paper books to eBooks (I'm old -- MSDOS old), I decided to get a (paper) copy and saw a good price from an Amazon re-seller.  But what I got differed physically quite a bit from the copy I'd borrowed from the library.  When I first received the paperback book from a 3rd party vendor, it seemed ""off"", as if it weren't new or even like new.  The cover had some wrinkling near the binding and the book is warped a bit, as if it was stored in a humid environment.  It's not warped in a way that makes it unusable, just in that way that gives the entire book a slight curl near the edges.  Furthermore, the binding seems ""stiff"" compared to other Manning Publications products; but this can happen if too much glue is used in the binding during fabrication process.  Then, as I flipped through the pages, a lot of them look like they were photocopied (!!!) as opposed to printed, especially with respect to the images.  The difference between what I received and the much higher quality book I'd borrowed from the library was dramatic in this regard.  I had a panic moment thinking I had purchased a well-done ""fake"" or illegal copy of the physical book (which might still be true).  Manning Publications let's you get a free eBook copy of many of their books, so I went through the steps and was able to register and get my eBook without any problems, so maybe the copy is legit after all.  If not, maybe I registered prior to the owner of the original?  I have no idea.  Since my purchase was through a 3rd party on Amazon and not Amazon directly, the eBook process worked, and it was inexpensive, I'm not going to waste more of my life beyond this review going through the hassle of trying to return it, since the content IS really good, and with wrinkled brow I can deal with with the annoyances of the sub-par product.  But I felt that it was important to bring awareness to the fact that either (i) there IS some possibility that illegal paperback copies are being sold, or (ii) that you might get a poorly produced physical copy.  If you prefer an ebook version, maybe go with that.  The PDF version I got after registration seems fine.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning with Python

I also got the second addition and I would recommend using that one just so you are working through up-to-date examples with tensorflow/keras. The field of deep learning is really vast and Chollet covers an impressive amount in this book mostly at a relatively high/applied level, which I think is a good thing.

For example, he doesn't use math equations to explain the theory of neural network but turn to Python code instead. It proves way easier to understand for me, someone working in industry for years. He begins by going straight into our first neural network, stating that ""we have to start somewhere"", which is a very good philosophy. During this ""going straight"" process, he knows exactly when I, as a beginner, will get puzzled and always put hints at the right place in the book, telling me not to worry if I don't something.

"I had high expectations for the book since it was written by the author of the language. I had also just finished Hand-On Machine Learning by Aurelien Geron which was absolutely fabulous and it was serving as a bit of a benchmark. Geron's book is packed full of information and written in a very step by step way. Chollet's book is written in a convoluted round about way and it is difficult to understand his points.The first 100 pages or so is on general deep learning and it is extremely basic. Even though I new these concepts I still found it difficult to follow. The writing is really bad.The more advanced concepts are not any better. Here is an example of the last section I read on page 172 before putting the book down for good.From the section Visualizing heartmaps of class activation""This general category of techniques is called class activation map ( CAM ) visualization,and it consists of producing heatmaps of class activation over input images. A class acti-vation heatmap is a 2D grid of scores associated with a specific output class, computedfor every location in any input image, indicating how important each location is withrespect to the class under consideration. For instance, given an image fed into a dogs-versus-cats convnet, CAM visualization allows you to generate a heatmap for the class“cat,” indicating how cat-like different parts of the image are, and also a heatmap for theclass “dog,” indicating how dog-like parts of the image are.The specific implementation you’ll use is the one described in “Grad- CAM : VisualExplanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization.” 2 It’s very simple:it consists of taking the output feature map of a convolution layer, given an inputimage, and weighing every channel in that feature map by the gradient of the classwith respect to the channel. Intuitively, one way to understand this trick is that you’reweighting a spatial map of “how intensely the input image activates different chan-nels” by “how important each channel is with regard to the class,” resulting in a spatialmap of “how intensely the input image activates the class.”Consider the image of two African elephants shown in figure 5.34 (under a CreativeCommons license), possibly a mother and her calf, strolling on the savanna. Let’s con-vert this image into something the VGG16 model can read: the model was trained onimages of size 224 × 244, preprocessed according to a few rules that are packaged inthe utility function keras.applications.vgg16.preprocess_input . So you need toload the image, resize it to 224 × 224, convert it to a Numpy float32 tensor, and applythese preprocessing rules.After reading this several times I still did not have a good mental formulation of how these heatmaps are put together. I also did not see the need to put in the paragraph about vgg16 preprocessing right here. It is just a distraction from the matter at hand.  The whole book is like this. I was wasting too much energy trying to understand what I believe are basic concepts.I recommend Ina Goodfellow's book on Deep Learning as well as Aurelien Geron's book. For Keras I would recommend the Deeplearning.AI course on Coursera as well as Deep Learning A-Z on Udemy. I do not know of a good Keras book at this time.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning with Python
"Coming from a non-data science background (IT networking), data science is an add-on skill to my foundation.  I do not need to fully understand all of the mathematical theory - instead I need to know how to use deep learning to develop use-cases.  I bought this book to understand what I could do with deep learning in Keras.  I got so much more than I expected.  Having written a single chapter in my own book about algorithms in general, I understand the challenges of trying to explain algorithms enough for general understanding, while not getting too far down the rabbit hole.

"This book claims to be ' A complete guide to learning Python basics..'. It basically identifies Data Types, control statements and Python functions without, in my opinion, showing clearly how they are used in Pythom programming. Also the book is quite baffling in it's descriptions.As an example, under the heading 'Rule of Immutability' it starts by saying ' There are exceptions to the immutability rule in Python' - should it not start by explaining  the Rule of Immutabilty ? (It never seems to do so). The same paragraph ends with 'As a result, while the value of Immutable objects could be modified, the value of their constituent objects can. Change the value of the variable'I don't know if this book has lost something in translation {assuming it was not originally written in English} but it's words of wisdom are certainly lost on me.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python Programming: A complete Guide to Learning Python basics and it’s Practical Applications in recent Development Technologies
"There seems to be a polarizing reviews on the book - a group loving it, and another hating.  I'm in the former group and my SVM says that this is a great book for those not having an expert knowledge of AI and Python.  I'm seeing that many of the processes in my job function may be changing with AI, and wanted to know how they would change.  Just looking at slide decks from consulting firms wasn't doing it.  I wanted a book that goes into more details on AI using Python as an example of the coding.  This is the perfect book.The author organizes and explains all of the aspects of AI and their applications.  The Python coding helps as an example of how the algorithms work.  The book is a great investment for me in that I'm sure I'll be able to communicate with programmers and developers of AI applications.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence Programming with Python: From Zero to Hero
"Book provides many code snippets with little to no explanation of how the author arrived at the code. Instead, you have page-long swaths of code snippets with meaningless exercises. Some of the exercises are so simple that they ask the user to essentially change one parameter of the model, which does not ensure that the reader is actually developing an understanding for the development of the model. Rather, it becomes a box-ticking exercise of changing the number of estimators of a random forest, with little discussion of the underlying statistics.The overall structure of the book follows little logical order as well as it begins with machine learning, goes into neural networks, and then ends with a section on data analysis. A much more natural approach would be to begin with data analysis, then move to machine learning, and finishing with neural networks and deep learning.The book also fails to go into sufficient depth when discussing other technologies, like Django and Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes. Each of these technologies receives only about a page of content -- it would have been better to send the reader somewhere else to learn more.It really seemed like the author wanted to write the book to ""cash in"" on the AI craze but failed to write a good book. I would instead suggest some of the books published by O'Reilly Media which tend to be much higher quality. If someone is looking for a free resource, I suggest they check out ""Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python"" which is available for free on PDF, written by Hastie and Tibshirani.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence Programming with Python: From Zero to Hero

"""In the Beginning"" is a good first introduction to the history of the Pythons. The book narrative is quite brief and doesn't cover anything of consequence that can't be found in ""The Pythons."" But the latter is a big, expensive book. This book is like a synopsis, containing the highlights but not much more. The DVD provides some interesting information in its interviews of the Python cast and includes clips from The 1948 Show, Do Not Adjust Your Set, How to Irritate People, etc. While these entire series are available, one can get the essence of what these earlier series (in which various of the Python cast members appeared) were about by watching the DVD.This is not what you want to buy if you already own everything remotely associated with the Pythons.

Good read,5.0 out of 5 stars,High Performance Python: Practical Performant Programming for Humans
"This book is a hidden gem. It explains in-depth methods for how to profile your Python programs, how to use different compilers for python code to gain speedups, how your code gets interpreted and how it interacts with the underlying computer architecture, how to write async code and parallel code in python, how to conserve RAM and many more topics and concepts. Each one of the concepts that this book teaches had a lot of work and effort put into by the authors. Wether it's the text or the code examples, the quality is high. The book is written in a way that you can read it in a linear fashion but it can also serve as a reference once you know where everything is. The authors of this book are very talented and experienced python developers with background in data science. In addition to showing many advanced methods for making your code fast, they put a strong emphasis on when/where to use each method and the importance of profiling and benchmarking.This book is probably a better read for people with an intermediate understanding of Python, operating systems and parallel programming. It uses very interesting and high quality problems as examples (warning, they are not always easy to understand).

"Good:  The book does a nice job covering multiple aspects of speeding up Python code, as well as reducing memory usage, etc.  Good examples with test results of different approaches.Not so good:  The book is probably twice as long as it should be.  There's a ton of filler in here, like the odd opinion notes about hard it is moving code to a cluster, or using multiprocessing.  The final section appears to be random thoughts about Python code, and has nothing to do with performance.Also, the writing style is just simply weird.  I was reading along about some topic, and all of a sudden the text says, ""Ian doesn't like to have his laptop set up so that ..."".  I thought, ""Who is Ian?, and why would I care about his opinion?""  Well, it turns out he's one of the two authors.

The dual-page text and code pairing approach is quite unique in Murach's books that makes learning easy.  The contents are written in very easy to understand and unambiguous way to make the reading easy and pleasant.

"We should begin by noting that the authors do seem to know what they're talking about.  They just don't communicate very well.  The book essentially assumes that you know everything about the field already and just wanted to look at a few pieces of example code, in which case you didn't need the book.  There are  numerous grammatical errors (perhaps forgivable for people writing in a second language), and errors in the equations that are less excusable.  Terms are often used without being defined; the code that is provided has few or no comments and no explanatory text.  There are very few figures to explain what is being done.  So if you need a list of relevant Python packages, the book might be useful, but as a learning tool it is unhelpful.Just for the record, the author of this review is also the author of three technical books that have been collectively cited in the technical literature over 1000 times, according to ResearchGate.

"Got this book in a python book bundle and thought that it would be a decent starting point to use python to start planning trades. Going through the book, this is for people that have a fairly broad knowledge of python, not just a basic working knowledge, since a lot of the chapters in this book are out of date.  The first 2 parts new users can kind of get through if they put in the work, but part 3 requires a lot of knowledge since the modules are out of date/not updated.The book also does a bad job of actually explaining anything.  The code is given and pictures showing what the code, as typed, should produce.  There is no explanation of any of the values in any of the code that is giving.  The book also does not really explain any of the results that you get, such as what you should do with any of the data.  This leads me to be very confused about who this book is for.  Programmers will know where to get all of the information in this book and none of the programming is that complex, but might not understand why having some of the graphs are important or what information is important from the information that is taught to scrape/get with an api.  Traders/financial analysts will understand most of the charts and what to do with the data, but will struggle getting through the coding in this book and understanding what can be changed to fit their needs.The best part of this book is probably Chapter 6 and 7, since most of the code works and this is where the book tells you what APIs to look for (NASDAQ LINK/quandl in the book, IEXCloud, YahooFinance module, marketstats and that is about it).",2.0 out of 5 stars,Hands-On Financial Trading with Python: A practical guide to using Zipline and other Python libraries for backtesting trading strategies
"Hands-on Financial Trading with Python is one of the best algorithmic trading books I’ve read. For those of you who want to get into the realm of Algo trading, you should not skip a single chapter of this book. As I am reading the book, I especially enjoy chapter 3, 4, and 5 where an in-depth elaboration of NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib Python libraries are presented with comprehensive and comprehensible hands-on codes with which I could follow long. However, chapter 6 does require some statistical background to be able to comprehend the time series models generated by FB’s Prophet library. Besides, I want to give the author a big shout-out to the zipline chapter. It was a pain for me to install and be able to code in a zipline environment when I just got started, and there weren’t many reliable resources on how to install zipline properly across different operating systems, as well as how to create custom data bundle, which this book provides. Therefore, you should not miss this book if you plan on getting started with zipline, as it will save you a lot of time.Moreover, I want to give the author a suggestion: if you could provide another chapter introducing the latest variant of zipline, i.e. zipline-trader, in terms of its new features, how to install it on Mac OS, as well as how to live-trade with it, this book will definitely be more informative to the intermediate and even advanced Algo traders.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands-On Financial Trading with Python: A practical guide to using Zipline and other Python libraries for backtesting trading strategies

"Serious Python is an interesting book. Let’s tart with chapter 1, which is about starting your project. This chapter covers the dos and don’ts of laying out your code project. You learn about version numbering and automated checks. Each chapter ends with an interview with someone in the Python community. For chapter 1, the interview is with Joshua Harlow.Chapter 2 digs into modules, libraries and frameworks. Here you get an overview of how Python’s import system works. The author spends a couple of pages listing out useful standard libraries and also talks about using external libraries too. He even mentions safety practices when downloading from external resources and you learn about pip.For chapter 3, you learn about writing good documentation and API with Sphinx. This chapter focuses almost exclusively on the Sphinx framework, which is what the Python team uses to document Python itself. You will learn about Sphinx modules and writing your own extensions to Sphinx here.In chapter 4, the topic is timestamps and time zones. You will learn how to use Python’s datetime library as well as the super cool dateutil module, which is an external module for Python. The author also spends some time talking about serializing datetime objects and solving ambiguous times.The topic of distributing your software is front and center in chapter 5. Here you will learn about using setup.py, setup.cfg and the wheel format. You will also discover how entry points work!For chapter 6, you will dig into unit testing with Python’s unittest module. Julien cover regular unittest as well as mocks and then gets into how to use the tox automation project.If you have been interested in decorators, static methods or class methods, then chapter 7 is for you. The entire chapter is devoted to these types of code constructs and goes one to talk about abstract methods too!In chapter 8, Julien teaches the reader how useful Python is for doing functional programming. He focuses on generators, list comprehensions and Python’s builtins, such as map(), filter() and enumerate() among others.The abstract syntax tree is the topic of choice for chapter 9. You will learn how to writing a program using AST as well as Hy, which is a dialect of Lisp that is embedded in Python. You can learn more about that project here. There is also a section about extending flake8 with AST.For chapter 10, you will learn about performance and optimization. Here the author uses Python’s cProfile and the dis module to understand the behavior of your programs. The rest of the chapter covers various optimization techniques, such as using memoization, PyPy, buffers, etc.In chapter 11, you will learn about scaling and architecture. The title of the chapter is a bit opaque in my opinion, as the actual topic is concurrency. Here you learn about Python threads, processes and asyncio. He also talks a little about ZeroMQ.If you happen to be interesting in learning how Python works with relational databases, then you’ll want to check out chapter 12. Here the author talks about various database backends and shows an example of using Flask with PostgreSQL.Finally in chapter 13, Julien covers using the six module to support writing your code for both Python 2 and 3. He also covers single dispatch and context managers in this chapter and then wraps it up by talking about the attrs package.While some of topics that are covered seem pretty obvious, I don’t actually see very many authors or bloggers talking about them all that often. For example, I only hear about scaling on rare occasions and even concurrency articles don’t come out all that often. The only real fault I can think of here is that I might have arranged the chapters in a slightly different order than the way they ended up. I would give the book a chance and check it out if you’d like to learn more about any of the above topics!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Serious Python: Black-Belt Advice on Deployment, Scalability, Testing, and More"
"Serious Python by Julien Danjou is an excellent book for those who have gone through the ""hello world"" tutorials or those coming to Python from other programming languages, and want a book that teaches you not just how to write code, but how to write code the pythonic way.You won't find chapters on mere syntax in this book: it expects that you've already covered the basics and want to move your Python skills to the next level. This covers a lot of ground that other Python books don't, and I'm glad I have it on my digital bookshelf.Chapter 1 covers laying out the files and folders for your Python project. This chapter was great, even for an experienced software developer like myself. I always threw everything into ""src"" and ""docs"" folders, but didn't quite understand how Python projects were formatted and, more importantly, why. And while I had heard about semantic versioning before, this book pointed out a couple things that I've been doing wrong with my version numbering for my entire career.Chapter 2 covers modules and importing, which is especially helpful from other languages that have similar, but distinct, ways of importing code.Chapter 3 covers not just documentation, but Python-specific documentation: the Sphinx tool, ReStructured Text, Sphinx extensions like autodoc and autosummary, and the warnings module. These are things I had been ignorant about for years while I was writing Python code, and it's great to find all this information in one place.Chapter 4 covers timestamps and time zones, and this is not just important Python information, but important programming information. Most programmers only learn about basic time/date-related functions and stop there. Time zones and the Olsen database and how to *properly* handle them are often ignored, resulting in subtle and hard-to-debug problems in software. Chapter 4 brings all of these issues to light, along with easy-to-miss Python modules that make working with dates and timezones manageable.Chapter 5 covers packaging and distributing Python code, which is especially complex given Python's history of various and overlapping package management tools. I wish there had been more information in this chapter, but it does act as a good introduction to a topic that you'd ordinarily only find out about piecemeal over a career.Chapter 6 covers unit testing (with pytest), fixtures, and mocks. It also covers code coverage.py tool for measuring the effectiveness of your unit tests.Chapter 7 covers decorators and static/class/abstract methods. This was a great chapter for me in particular, because it's a topic that I've been getting by on by copy/pasting decorator code from other projects and, while that worked, I didn't have a full understanding of *why* the code worked until I read this chapter. The same applies  to static and class methods in Python, which are easy to misuse.Chapter 8 covers functional programming concepts. While Python isn't a functional programming language, it does have many features that support (and benefit from) writing code in a functional style. For anyone who doesn't know about functional programming, or was burned before when trying to learn the topic, this is a must-read chapter.Chapter 9 is the only chapter that I feel like isn't absolutely required reading. It's nice to have a chapter on abstract syntax trees (especially since Python comes with the ast module to help navigate Python code), but it isn't relevant to most programmers. Still, I'd rather read this chapter than try to find out about the topic from some random web tutoiral.Chapter 10 covers performance and optimization, explaining not just the cProfile module but also the dis module for disassembling Python bytecode for analysis. While this might not be directly necessary for most performance improvements, it does give a good introduction to the idea that Python bytecode isn't mystical at all; and you can directly compare how different bits of Python code are compiled to bytecode. There's also a hefty list of need-to-know, Python-specific tricks to writing faster code.Chapter 11 and 12 cover process and databases, respectively. I wish these chapters were longer, but like many of the short sections, they provide a good introduction to several concepts that many programmers are unaware of, so they are worth a read-through.Chapter 13 covers a few miscellaneous topics that don't quite fit in any other chapter, but I'm glad he covers them. Context managers, unicode, data classes (using the attrs module), and Python 2/3 support are definitely important to have in your Python toolbox.This book could easily have been ten times its current length, but I like that it is to the point and it does a great job guiding the reader through the most important topics that aren't always covered by other books. ""Serious Python"" is a book you need to read if you're serious about following mature processes and being a capable Python programmer. It's filled with practical information that's normally scattered across web tutorials, conference talks, and Stack Overflow posts, but has been compiled here into one an excellent book. 5 stars.(Full disclosure: I'm an author for No Starch Press, but No Starch Press didn't ask me to write this review and I purchased a copy on my own.)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Serious Python: Black-Belt Advice on Deployment, Scalability, Testing, and More"

"It’s a great and fact filled book but the only problem is that is says ball pythons should be in a smaller tank but you should really keep them in a 40 gallon minimum and better yet a 4 x 2 x 2 pvc reptile habitat with swing acrylic locking doors because you should never pick up a reptile from above. In fact if you let a ball python free range your house ( I would never recommend this) and you had a few water bowls and heat lamps throughout the house along with a few hides, the snake would be perfectly fine. So this is generally a good book besides that and some grammatical errors. ( note: this was written by a ten year old who has had an interest in herpetology ( study of reptiles and amphibians) since the early age of 3 years old. I currently own a leopard gecko and am always wanting to grow my collection more and more away from lizards and invertebrates.

"The book was certainly shorter than I thought, and I feel like I've gotten more information from the internet and from herp YouTubers. What is in this book feels like a rushed pamphlet version of whatever you might find as a care guide online, with a lot of repeating parts and fluff to fill it. I also caught a few typos, but that is moreso whatever editor's fault. She is right to say that it is ""written for the non-expert,"" but in truth it feels like it was written by one as well. I finished this book in about 15 minutes tops and feel like I didn't learn anything that I already found online, with some advice being better than hers from further research. Either keeping a ball python is way easier than I've seen reptile keepers warn about, or this was written as a parody as an already-made care guide.

"People often talk about ""that book"" they wish they had when they first started programming. For me, this is that book. I've been studying Python, off and on, for a while now, and had already collected a couple of excellent books on the subject. I've also gone through various tutorials online. I like to see what's out there, and try different approaches to learning. This book caught my eye while I was browsing the shelf at my local book store.Probably the least important, but still important at least to me, is the books formatting: it's incredible. The binding, pages, color schemes, and style are 2nd to none. It may sound superficial, but I feel like I learn better from a book if it is enjoyable to use.Now onto the content. This is an introduction to Python. However, it's actually an introduction to Programming, with the Python language. The difference is subtle, but important. ""Begin to Code"" - ""With Python."" This is a book that goes into detail that other books don't, because it's target audience is people who want to learn how to Code. One of the things I've realized from self study is that writing programs is so much more than learning a language. It's about the fundamental principles that come with practice and experience, and when these are learned, can then be applied to ANY language. Material that guides students towards thinking like a programmer are fewer and far between compared to those that are dedicated to just teaching a language. This one does both.Throughout the book are what are called ""Programer's Points,"" where Rob gives insight into several different topics that deal with the subject being discussed. They are based on his experience as a programmer. I have never seen this in an instructional book before. It's presented in a way that makes the book both meaningful and personal.There is also 3 book features, each color coded with the page, which I found interesting and pleasantly presented. ""Make Something Happen"" offers practice exercises. ""Code Analysis"" walks through example code, and ""What Could Go Wrong,"" offers tips when a program fails. These are all elements that can be found in other books. However, one thing Rob does here, is he has several Q&A's, with every chapter. If there is one thing a beginning Programmer has, it is questions, and this book brings them, and answers them as well. As far as actual Python coverage, it has everything you'd expect from an introductory book.The overall tone of the book is light, and Rob definitely has a sense of humor. This is not a boring text book. In addition to having a sense of humor, the book is quite insightful throughout. Lots of stuff to actually chew on, outside of Python. I recommend this book to anyone who is just starting out, or if you've been at it for a while, but feel like there is more to Programming than just learning a language, but aren't sure where to find that missing material. This is that book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Begin to Code with Python

"This book is excellent for new comers like myself. The writing in this book is clearly thought out and it does what a lot of books don't, and that is to get you in the mindset of a programmer. Don't get me wrong you will need another book that goes into even greater detail on specific command, but for beginners this book is perfect to get your feet wet. I noticed that other books I look at don't teach you the mindset of thinking and thinking logically like a programmer. Other books just give you the introduction and a bunch of codes to copy without actually teaching you the meaning of why you must think like this or use this a certain way ( I hope that makes sense). Don't get me wrong I have a secondary book that gives exact directions on what to type and how to type it but that's all they do, while this book gives you both. I recommend this book because it gives you what others don't as well as it teaches you commands and functions in a structured format. It also gives you links to other resources and websites to help you along your journey of becoming a python programmer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Begin to Code with Python

"I absolutely love this book. It is fascinating, interesting and enlightening. I understand python quite well,  and came upon this book as I looked for a different approach to teaching python programming (my audience is advanced high school/community college). This is almost the perfect book. I say almost because of the cognitive load demands presented by this masterpiece. Only about 20% of the students I teach could handle both the learning of a computer language and the mathematical content of this book simultaneously. However, it would be perfect for a four-year university. Perfect. But not for one of those big-tent, inclusive (I don’t mean gender or racial inclusivity; I mean academic focus) courses. You know that kind of course: an introductory buffet, designed to provide a survey. This is for passionate programmers who want to apply programming to do creative things. The book teaches Python in the context of cryptography, computer vision, statistics, fractals and more. Python programming as a means, not an end. If this class were taught as a freshman-level course at a major university, targeted at CS majors, it would be the most popular class on campus. It is not appropriate for any student with the slightest bit of anxiety regarding his/her ability to handle programming. At least that’s my humble opinion. But the authors are simply brilliant. They take these sophisticated concepts and explain them in such a clear and concise way, it is simply amazing. This is one of those books, at least in my case, that you cannot put down. And it’s a programming book for crying out loud!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Programming in Context

"This was the textbook for a condensed online class I took recently. I was eager to learn Python for ArcGIS Pro and found this book very helpful overall, with a couple minor complaints. I had minimal experience with Python previously, just some very basic stuff I learned on my own during my first attempt at learning it. Had never used it with any ArcGIS products. The book actually helped flesh out my lectures and were probably more helpful than my lectures since I could take my time going through it very carefully. I'm planning on buying the advanced scripting for Pro book by the same author.Two things that could make this book even more helpful:1) Exercises at the end of each chapter that walk you through some of this stuff on your own with data provided by the manufacturer's website. I'm surprised that wasn't available here. For coding especially, reading through the text is one thing but actually doing an entire exercise on your own really helps the material stick. Hopefully that is in future editions.2) The book is mostly in paragraph form and there were a lot of instances when it would have been helpful to have concepts broken down in an outline or list format. That's just a personal preference for learning for me but with so much new material for a newbie, I think that would go a long way here. For example, listing out the methods or functions available for a module. I often had to sift through and reread the chapters and highlight areas that helped me hone in on this stuff. Even an appendix at the end would be helpful. The ArcGIS Pro help documentation online has this but having it available in the book while reading through the concepts would be nice.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Scripting for ArcGIS Pro

"The publisher drastically limits the amount of highlights you can copy or export. For a technical book like this, that eliminates most of the digital copy value.

I was going to buy the sequel, but have instead found alternatives from other publishers that offer more flexibility.Useful content, but it needs a much more detailed Table of Contents to help looking things up when trying to code.

"I had some knowledge about this spirit in the early 90's when I lived in Phoenix, AZ. At that time during a session of intercessory Prayer we were able to deal with it as it had a stranglehold on our finances. Things were so bad that when after this spirit was dealt we saw dramatic improvements to our finances and never bothered about it again. Fast forward to 2014, I bought a Kindle fire as my instrument of reading. I came across this book in kindle Version and  I intuitively realized that a family member, who started the year in excellent health began to experience a precipitous decline in her health dropping about 60 lbs. within a four month period and was so weak and experiencing other medical problems that Cat scans, x-rays, blood test, and MRIS,  could not locate any problem.. I studied this book for three weeks and one night moved by the Holy Spirit as she laid perturbed in bed I went into her bedroom and commanded her to get up and helped her up and started to bind and cast out that Spirit of Python Both of us immediately felt the release and as I continue to wage warfare  against that Spirit for the first time I heard her beginning to speak in tongues,, she got energetic and  we began to start praising and worshipping God. She was laying in bed for the last at least 20 hours per day for four months before, weak, depressed, and in pain, hardly eating unable to Pray.  This book enabled  me to add immense knowledge to my faith, to deal with this situation that now I can boldly proclaim that that woman has been loosed from the Spirit of Python, is nearly back to her normal self and the reality that we wrestle not with flesh and blood. enables us to use the weapons of our warfare that are mighty in God, to pull down strong holds and live the abundant life Jesus came so that we can have.

"The book covers the steps to build a large and multifaceted project. If you go through all of it, you will have a good understanding of Python and particularly data-generated games.

Then I can give these files to students to skip all that typing. However, this does cause some issues with how image paths are handled by Pygame Zero in the Mu editor.

"The author provides a complete and clear review of the Python programming language library. There are many examples.  Python is a powerful programming language with a clean syntax and a rich library system.  It is suitable for the novice and for the advanced programmer. Many large companies use it to program their operation.  I believe that Amazon is one of them.The wealth of our imagination is possibly the only limit to what can be done with Python.

"While this book is a great resource for Python scripting in ArcGIS, it's more of an introductory desk reference. The backcover touts that there are example datasets and exercises. The book mainly goes over sample code to explain different features of ArcPy but there really wasn't too much in the way of hands on tutorial within the book. It's basically a broad overview of scripting to get you started. For me, this was great because I already had in mind what I wanted out of scripting and have some knowledge of the Python language. The book is helpful in orienting me in the right direction.I did use another resource, the eBook version of 
ArcPy and ArcGIS - Second Edition
. These two books go well together. Zandbergen's Python Scripting for ArcGIS is well-written but has no practice exercises. Silas Tom's ArcPy and ArcGIS has plenty of exercises and practice datasets but isn't as intuitive when it comes to explanations.If you know where you want to go and just need some broad guidance, Zandbergen is the way to go.

"This is rare book because most of the parts in ArcPy is covered. You can learn from how to set up python environment to how to create your own toolbox. Even after you read through this book, you can use this book as encyclopedia for ArcPy.The only one problem is monotonicity. Through chapters, the author show the code without any real-world analysis. So you may feel boring at the middle of this book. To avoid falling into such a pitfall, I recommend you to pull the real data from the web and apply it to the codes shown in this book.Finally, As is clear from the tittle, this book is exclusively for the people who are using ArcGIS, not for people who wanna conduct geospatial analysis by using python.

"This book is a fine companion to Jennings' A Python Primer for ArcGIS.  In fact, it's kind of hard to buy one without the other.  Together they make one book.  I would recommend that, if you're a visual learner driven to absorb concepts, start with Zandbergen then dig into Jennings' for some really fine exercises and coding practices.  However, if you're a tactile learner (like me), get under the hood and get your hands dirty with Jennings.  Get to where you can comfortably do these exercises.  And then dive into the why's and wherefore's behind them in the Zandbergen text.Yes, I am a ""shoot first, and ask questions later"" type of guy.  Jennings' text lets me dive in.  But Zandbergen's is a well-written text that covers a number of tools beyond what Jennings treats.  Zandbergen's exercises, in accompanying .pdf's, are--not very good.

No, but it inspired me and provided me with a solid foundation that was necessary to achieve many goals. The book really covers everything you need to be a proficient user of the ArcPy package.

"This is a strange book in terms of its target audience.The book's focus of the first two-thirds is surveying the tools and packages available in the scientific stack - numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, etc. This is the best part of the book, as it provides quick overviews of how the core functionality works with decent examples. I work in a bulge bracket bank, and I take this book to work with me every day to use as a reference - much of what I want to do in Python, there's going to be a section or example with which to build off of.This book sticks to the basics of Python and its packages. Each chapter in this book will have entire books written about the subject matter. But, like much in life, 20% of the effort yields 80% of the results. This is a book which will have you quickly working with the scientific stack because it's focus on the core 80% of what you need to know, not all the ins-ands-outs of any particular application or package.However, this book has a series of flaws in increasing order of severity:1. (Very mild, maybe not a flaw at all) There is little-to-no explanation of the actual finance. For example, when doing Monte Carlo simulations, the author generates geometric brownian motion sample paths using the euler discretization of the SDE under the risk-neutral measure. I find it hard to believe that someone without prior background knowledge would be able to understand what the author is doing. This may not be an issue, as this is a Python book and not a finance book, but it does limit the potential readership - those of us with a solid foundation in finance, including stochastic calculus, but with only a limited knowledge of basic python. I don't believe there are too many people out there like this. I was transitioning from using R as my primary language, and so the book made sense for me.2. (Moderate) The Algorithmic Trading section seems to require that you make an account with the FXCM platform and place actual trades. Others have claimed that such an account requires thousands of dollars, which I'm simply unwilling to pay. I need to do more looking into this, but I would much prefer a free sandbox account with which to pull and work with historical data.3. (Severe) Portions of the code don't work from my experience. I cannot get the Pymc3 package to work, as I and many other first-time users encounter an endless string of errors and version conflicts. The authors of the package say to use their installation steps, but those have not yielded better results. The tensorflow code in this book is for the outdated version. This book gives scikit-learn examples with outdated parameters. In general, I'm pretty unforgiving when a book has entire sub-sections which need to be skipped.As an introduction to the scientific stack, the first 460 pages are decent enough and can be used as a basic reference. But this book disappointed me in the back end. Moreover, you will need to have some prior finance background to follow the book in its entirety.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Finance: Mastering Data-Driven Finance
"""Python is the programming language and technology platform of choice, not only for this book but for almost every leading financial institution.  However, Python deployment can be tricky at best and sometimes even tedious and nerve-wracking.  Fortunately, several technologies that can help with the deployment issue have become available in recent years.""  Python for Finance, page 56.Dr. Hilpisch's book is an end to end explanation and demonstration of the complete process of setting up and using Python for financial data science.He begins with selection of software and installation on either a local computer or on cloud facilities.  He has chosen a set of software packages that are fully compatible with each other, easily installed, open source and free, well documented, and well supported.The next few chapters review the structure and use of Python.  The examples are well chosen and clearly explained.  Real financial data is used when possible.  He addresses the criticism that Python is slow by showing that alternative methods -- sometimes as simple as rewriting a single line of code -- can result in significantly improved execution speed.Analysts spend large portions of their time and effort on data preparation.  Beginning with real financial data, well chosen examples show how to inspect, clean, transform, and display data series.Analysis of risk and opportunity requires understanding of the distributions involved.  Dr. Hilpisch devotes several chapters to Monte Carlo analysis.  Illustrative examples include pricing of derivatives.The sections of the book that discuss algorithmic trading use the FXCM platform.  FXCM focuses on currency pairs, along with a few global indexes and a few commodities.  The raw historical data is ticks -- each a bid/ask pair.  The FXCM API provides tools to form OHLC bars of whatever length is desired.  The text provides examples using the raw ticks as well as the consolidated bars in trading systems.  The API also allows order placement and management.  A free demo account allows access to downloading data (1 minute bars and longer) and testing trading.Several trading systems are illustrated.  These range from very simple moving average crossover to machine learning.Profitable trading systems have, at their core, trade secrets.  As it does not contain secrets, this book will be of little value to readers hoping to read one book and be rich by Wednesday.  You will need to supply your own secret techniques for selection of auxiliary variables, data transformations, and target definition.  With those in hand, this book will clarify your path and speed your development.

"So first, my motivation for buying this book -- after reading tons of articles about algorithmic trading, I took the bait and decided to buy this book to learn more about how to apply programming to investment analysis.  I took a home study course in Python a couple years ago, and (with references back to ""Python Crash Course"") was able to follow along with the examples in this book through Ch 7.  I found Dr. Hilpisch quite straightforward and generally easy to follow, again with some reference back to my Python book and similar websites.I then hit a wall in Ch 8, which is on Financial Time Series.  You of course need data to perform this type of analysis, and this book chose to use Thomson Reuters Eikon Data API (application programming interface) from which to retrieve historical data.  The problem is that this site is not free, and the cheapest subscription is $3,600/yr.  If I worked for a financial services firm, this software would probably be a given, but as an individual investor this is not realistic.I do have an account with a popular online broker, which has a free API, but the book does not specify what type of data is being pulled, in order to replicate the retrieval there.  I would suggest that the author simply share a sample data file(s) on his website to use for these chapters, in order to illustrate the concepts in the book.  Please don't assume we have professional grade data subscriptions, or at least spell it out in the book's description, if you do (similar to stating that some basic knowledge of Python and Finance is a prerequisite).The author does provide a web page address for the book in the preface (http://bit.ly/python-finance-2e), but it was not very helpful in overcoming the issue described above.I'm still covering the chapters that I can finish without retrieval from an API, but it's rather disappointing that one cannot follow along with much of the more interesting material, without having access to Thompson Reuters.My overall grade for this book is an ""A"" for the concepts covered and how well they are explained, but a ""D"" in terms of making live data available for those sections requiring it.

"I like this book more than I expected I would.When I read through the TOC, I was halfway expecting an in-depth treatment of both Python and Rust. There wasn't any in-depth treatment of either -- but the author carefully explained that up front. The purpose of the book was to explain how to use Rust and Python together, and the author did a good job of that. A real in-depth treatment would have taken 1000+ pages instead of 351.If you are unfamiliar with either Python or Rust, you should probably read a book on each of those first -- and try some programming in each. I am familiar with Python, but not so much with Rust, so I was thinking I could just skim the Python parts. I was wrong there, too. I ended up learning a substantial amount about the inner workings and management of Python (and pip, and GitHub, too).This is one of those books that I will need to read more than once, and I will also need to come more up to speed on Rust. The author, Maxwell Flitton, provided a lot of ""further reading"" recommendations which I plan to pursue.Mr. Flitton did a fairly good job of convincing me that Rust is something worth learning, although I expect to benefit just from my improved understanding of pip, Docker, and other Python topics.Flaws... well, the flaws were minor, and not enough to ding the rating over. The only real irritation to me was that there were some typos (occasionally losing a space between words), and a few awkward sentences that made me re-read some sections more than once before I finally figured out what was being said.

I tried a few of the implementations and it works perfectly.I would definitely recommend this book to advance Python users to widen their view of integrating their code with Rust to bring the best of both the programming languages.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Speed Up Your Python with Rust: Optimize Python performance by creating Python pip modules in Rust with PyO3
"I never used these cards while I was consistently using python.

"If a fundamental skill of programming is finding syntax errors, this deck of cards is for you. Here's a typical example of the dozen + typos. On Function Card 6.3 the input parameters are designated as (msg, user), but the code uses the variable names: user, message. Since the input parameter is designated as msg rather than message, the code generates a run time error. There's no  reason why simple programming snippets should contain so many typos.

"To sum it up in one sentence, this book is an excellent reference for caring for the longest living snake, one I give a solid 5 stars. To elaborate, this is the book anyone should start reading if they want to begin understanding the reticulated python and its care. I've been learning a lot from this book and other sources as well, as the reticulated python is a dream species for me to own and interact with. For example, three types of retic (as I will refer to them) exist. Mainland, dwarf, and super dwarf. Dwarf and superdwarf retics are fairly small compared to the giants on mainland Asia that reach 20+ feet. This is due to limited space, genetics, and other factors. Dwarf retics generally max out at 15 feet for a dwarf retic and 10 feet for particularly large super dwarfs based on which islands they come from. The smaller the island, the smaller the reticulated python, and some, like those from tiny Karompa Island, don't get bigger than 7 feet as adults. These smaller retics are the ones I want to work with as pets, as I know my limits with the size of the snakes I can safely own. As I also know some breeders specialize in super dwarf retics, there are options on where to obtain these miniature retics. Reticulated pythons are not aggressive, but it should be noted that they are very smart and food-motivated snakes. This book teaches you some tips on how to showcase you are not a threat or offering food, and how to safely interact with a retic of any size. The book goes over the safest way to let them know you are a friend to trust, through tap training, positive reinforcement, and more. Beyond this, the book showcases the many different color morphs that retics display, and new color morphs are created all the time, so there's no limit to their beauty. This book also talks about enclosures for Reticulated pythons, not to mention treating health issues, caring for them, and breeding them. Combining this with research you do yourself is something that will help you in the event you want to try raising these beautiful snakes yourself, but be prepared for lots of interactions; these are active, strong animals, and they like to explore, so you'll definitely want to let them out under supervision to get some mental stimulation, because these snakes should not spend every day in a terrarium alone. Some places also have bans on keeping reticulated pythons, so do your homework, because some areas won't let you keep them, often for the fact that on very rare occasions they can be dangerous due to their size and strength (an unfortunate prejudice against these reptiles, especially since dogs and cats cause more incidents involving serious injuries than pet pythons ever have). This is also a snake that should be interacted with every other day as an adult at least, and the costs of keeping a large retic are significant. Can you afford this snake? Can you afford its enclosure? Its food? Its veterinary care when it needs it? Perhaps this book can help you figure that out. It certainly is for me. Combined with talking to retic breeders and owners, this book is an excellent step on my path to one day becoming a responsible super dwarf retic owner. I hope it can help do the same for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reticulated Pythons: A complete guide to care and husbandry

"If you are not on a Mac - disregard this review.  Windows is likely much more forgiving.If you are on a Mac and feel comfortable having your kid run Minecraft and Python under an admin account (yours, most likely) - disregard this review.If you are relaxed about security on your Mac - disregard this review.If you want an opinion on the teaching value of this book, look at other reviews.Still here?OK, the main problem is that Mac files can be very sensitive to the ownership of the files.  Normally, that is not really a problem, you install a program and it goes under Applications and everyone can use it.  This is not really the case here, only the person doing the installation can use it without tweaking.  And the tweaking is NOT easy to do.On to the actual issues...(note:  I have posted fairly detailed steps corresponding to what I did to get it work as an Amazon product discussion on this book's page.)Step #3 - installing Java Development KitThe author tells you to install Java.  This is both unnecessary and risky.  Java on a Mac installs itself as Java + the Java web plugin.  The Java web plugin consistently has security problems and savvy web users tend to disable it whenever possible.  Additionally, once installed, a Mac's Java install does not allow removal of Java itself and makes it very difficult to disable the web plugin for other users (despite being an admin).Minecraft's authors have recognized the problems Java install cause and bundle their own Java embedded in their files.  All the install instructions had to tell you was to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to Minecraft's own Java.Presto, no more need to install Java itself.  I did that, but not before again installing the #@!^& Java as per the instructions.  Thanks for having me saddled with an unpleasant security risk.Step #4 - Installing The Minecraft Python API and Spigot.You know that MinecraftTools Mac.zip file you downloaded?  The one from sourceforge which takes 10-20 minutes to download because it's so slow?Wherever you extract it, its owner will be you.  In Mac terms, that means your kid, if running under his own account rather than yours, is not authorized to read those files.  That's even if you put them under the Shared user.  Easy to see, just look at the files under Finder, press command+I and check the Sharing and Permissions.To run this stuff, you need Read, Write, Execute access.  Your own user has it - your kid and everyone else doesn't.There is a solution, but it is not pleasant.  First you create a new usergroup in the Mac, then, for all the files you extracted, you assign the same rights as the owner to that group.  Finally you make your kid a member of the group.Step 1. Minecraft.Turns out that, strangely enough, the Minecraft program itself can have these permission issues.  That's unusual, I've never seen a Mac application that installs with this problem, but there it was.  You can google up """"Minecraft + El Capitan + Legacy Java"" and find the issue on Mac Support forums.  The fix was the same as before for me, assign the owner's right to the group.Now, this one is definitely not the author's responsibility.  More Minecraft's.If you install the stuff for this book under an admin user and then let your kid run it directly under that user, none of these problems likely show up. Except for the unnecessary Java installation.If, like me, you have your kids set up with their own, unprivileged, account then it is likely you will have the same problems as me.  Unix and Mac permissions are tricky, but essential to get right if you want to share data between users.I do this kinda of work for a living and it wasn't too hard to fix things, only took me 4-5 hours to understand what was going on.  Part of what slowed me down is it was an old Mac, just reformatted to use El Capitan, so I was missing all my regular diagnostic utilities.  Still, I just don't think the installation instructions are good enough for Mac users.Suggestion to author:  include a link within the book to detailed installation instructions online.  Don't try to cover all the bases in the book itself, too complicated.  But do set up such a help site - it's too bad that such a useful teaching book can be so difficult to install.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Learn to Program with Minecraft: Transform Your World with the Power of Python
"As a professional software developer, I have to say that this is one of the best introductory level programming books I’ve ever seen. It tells kids just what they need to know to understand what they’re doing, and they get the immediate reward of seeing the action carried out in the game. It consistently links the lessons to results in the game, making it easy to stick with.It’s printed in full color so the code has syntax highlighting and images from the game to illustrate what it’s doing. Python was a good choice for the language to use, as it’s easy to learn and was created with the goal of being easy to understand by anyone.I got this for my son, who is 11, and loves Minecraft. He’s already done a fair amount to customize things himself and was very excited to take that further. I think this book is appropriate for any kid with the attention span and interest to try it out. The constant reward of seeing their work pay off will give them the excitement and confidence to drive them forward.They will need help from time to time, but even if you yourself don’t have experience programming, the book is very clear and should give you what you need to walk them through it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learn to Program with Minecraft: Transform Your World with the Power of Python

Click on Edit Profile.Step 3: Change Profile Name to ""Spigot 1.9.2"" or ""Spigot - Python 1.9.2"" (You decide what name you want, I always put the game version in the name.  It is easier for me to keep track with which version I am having to playing with)Step 4: Under ""Version Selection"" click the box that says ""Allow use of  old ""Alpha"" Minecraft Versions""(a box will pop up, click ""yes"")Step 5: Now select the ""release 1.9.2"" (You need this release because the Spigot version is for 1.9.2. This applies to any server you use.)Step 6: Save ProfileStep 7: You will select this Profile you created every time you want to play on this server.If you are not sure if which version of Minecraft spigot is running on, run your Spigot server.  Now on the server screen, scroll up all the way to the top and one of the top few lines should read ""Starting Minecraft server version +++++.""

"Many reviews on this book say that it is outdated and doesn't work with Minecraft. It is true that the setup instructions are outdated, in that they refer to old, unsupported versions of software, and that the author's own distribution of the software is old. However, all the programming exercises work fine if you just ignore the setup instructions and download the newest versions of needed software yourself from the official sources (which is what I would recommend anyway): Java, Python, py3minepi, Minecraft, Spigot server, and the RaspberryJuice plugin for Spigot server. The setup depends on having a client component (py3minepi) loaded into Python that talks to a server API component (RaspberryJuice) in Spigot server. If none of that made sense to you, this book probably isn't for you.I'm a professional software developer with a 7-year-old son who said he wanted to try coding. While the content is clear and easy to understand, I still think he's too young for this book. He quickly lost interest and kept pointing out how he could accomplish the same things using command blocks etc. inside Minecraft.At the time of writing this, Minecraft 1.12 was the latest version, and what I used.

"I teach programming to kids. Although this book is advertised as a beginner book for kids with no programming experience, I think it works better as an advanced book after they have learned some basic Python programming from a book like No Starch Press’ Python For Kids by Jason Briggs. I am really impressed by the quantity of material that this book covers, though. Lots of mods that you can write using Python that I would never even think of. It is unlikely that anybody would ever do all of the projects in this book. Better to pick and choose the more interesting ones.It’s true as other reviewers have said that setting up the programming environment is tricky. I found that the best and easiest is to install PyCharm Edu and the raspberryjam mod for Minecraft Forge. Then you don’t need to run the Spigot Minecraft server. You do development inside the mcpipy directory in your .minecraft directory, which avoids the need to install the out-of date py3minepi package (Python 3 Minecraft pi edition API)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn to Program with Minecraft: Transform Your World with the Power of Python
"I like the book, so far. My only complaint is with the Kindle formatting of the python code on an iPad. The code looks fine on my Kindle Paperwhite, but when I try to read the code on my iPad (where I can view it much larger) the python code is sometimes unreadable. For instance, in the very first examples of using python the code appears to read "">>> 2  2+"" instead of "">>> 2 + 2"". Other examples are even more difficult. Changing the font didn't seem to help.Other than that, I was able to install all the Mac Tools and get everything working on the first try. There are complaints here about the included Spigot Minecraft server not being compatible with the latest Minecraft release, but there's no way that the author can keep up with the release schedule of Mojang.

"i don't think it has to be so challenging to learn functional programming. The examples given assume you have  background in higher level math or other areas that are not necessarily for a laymen. I don't think i should have to get my math book out in order to understand the example of how mutability works. Do I need to know how nuclear fission works in order to be able to run on a lightbulb?

I have a background in Scala and I was able to learn functional programming much easier from mark lewis.. where I did not have to get all my books from undergrad out, just to be able to grasp the concept. I guess things are just easier these days, for example I have data engineers working for me doing machine learning, and they are leveraging the ml libraries to get it done, without having the background in statistics. When I speak to them and I take them into the deep dive, they get lost, but the results that are produced are just as impactful. In summary, it is my opinion, that if you have your math books, and a dictionary... and can get through the examples presented, then you might actually get to what is trying to be taught... If not... then you will be posting a review that says ""this is a good book and a great way to start to learn functional programming in python"" while you kind of chalk up the 22 bucks you wasted buying this encyclopedia to put on your shelf, while you find something that is easier to understand with simple examples, written in laymen's terms.

"This is a great book for intermediate to advanced Py users who want to harness the power of Pythonin the functional programming space. The book provides good foundational ideas of functional programming as introductions and then the collections, generators and higher order functions. The book goes into reasonable depths of modules like iterables, Functools and few packages as well. I personally learnt a ton on Decorators in this book. The book does provide some snippets that one can incorporate in their tasks, but definitely there is a degree of learning to think like Functional programming. Overall a great read but some solid background in Py programming is extremely helpful.

"The author clearly knows their stuff, and covered a wealth of great patterns in Python and how to use higher order functions and built-ins to write more composable and maintainable code. That being said, I do not recommend this for a first introduction to functional programming. The book is very large and spread out, so the useful nuggets of FP may be hard to discern for a newbie. It may even dissuade some people from using FP as the rationale is not clearly explained as to how to better use FP practices. However, if you're familiar with FP already, this book does a good job in explaining how Python tackles functional code.I do think the book got bloated at times, as three chapters are pretty much dedicated to itertools and functools (Which are super useful and the author does a good job explaining when to use them), but it mostly rehashed what's available on standard docs. However, I did appreciate the introduction of other libraries in the book to make code more functional.There are examples at the end of each chapter, which I'm always a fan of, and they seemed thoughtful and relevant to the discussion at hand.If the author ever goes for a 2nd edition, I recommend streamlining the book to be more focused and emphasizing the benefits of FP more up-front throughout the book. Also, an appendix with selected answers to exercises annotated with FP benefits would be a great addition.Disclosure: I was provided an early review copy from the publisher and was asked to review this work.

"The book Functional Python Programming is a comprehensive text that examines, illustrates, and discusses functional programming using the Python programming language. Python is an object-oriented language but can be used functionally in the paradigm of functional programming.The book is organized into sixteen chapters, starting from the fundamentals of functional programming, and functions, and then concludes applied functional programming with several applications.The book has approximately four sections yet not of consistent size in chapters. The first two chapters are an introduction, laying the foundation. The second, next section is five chapters that build more complex topics with higher-order functions, recursion, and stateless objects. The third section examines various modules for use in functional programming in Python. The fourth section is an example of applications using functional programming in Python.Functional programming is an area where such languages as LISP and Scala reign supreme, but the difficulty is learning a new paradigm of thought whilst learning the nuances and syntax of another programming language. This process can be and is frustrating and disillusioning for a learner. This is why functional programming in Python is a very helpful book. In the second part of the learning process, the programming language is alleviated by using the Python programming language.The book examines and demonstrates using functional programming with Python in applications that are natural for functional programming: recursion, combinations, permutation, and computing the chi-square value. Some not-so-obvious applications are web services, multiprocessing, concurrency, and threading. The book covers a wide variety of topics and subjects.The book goes immediately into functional programming, the concepts, and functions as first-class objects in Python. Then the material goes to iterators, generators, and functional approaches in applying them. From there the book goes into working functionally with collections, and data structures. Higher-order functions used in functional programming are examined with functional mapping and filters. Lambda or anonymous functions are examined and Python lambda functions illustrate the concept.The book continues with recursion and recursive functions, and then into complex stateless objects in Python. Then several modules relating to functional programming are examined--itertools, functools, and pymonad. The functional programming then examines applications such as process threads, concurrency, web services, and statistical chi-squared values.Overall the book is an excellent source and reference for functional programming using the Python programming language. The text is comprehensive in scope from the basic foundation of functional programming, functions as first-class objects, modules for functional programming, and then applications of Python using functional programming. The Python source code is provided, illustrative, and available for download. Hence a reader can immediately run the example Python source code, tinker with it, and learn by doing.A problem is ""all over the place"" covering many a topic to illustrate functional programming but going from multi-processing and concurrency to web services, to the measure of statistical randomness chi-squared. The book is illustrative yet is incoherent coverage of different topics around functional programming with Python.There is an implicit requirement--knowledge and some skill with the Python programming language and environment. This book is not suited to learning Python, but to learning functional programming, Python modules, and Python functionality.The book Functional Python Programming is an excellent tool for Python software developers to take their skills to the next level and another paradigm of thinking--the functional programming paradigm. The comprehensive nature of the book makes it an excellent book to learn and as a reference going forward. However, the vastness of the material and the different paradigms of functional programming are not for a newbie learning Python.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Functional Python Programming: Use a functional approach to write succinct, expressive, and efficient Python code, 3rd Edition"
"Steven starts with the basics and then shows how to use functional thinking and methods in different situations by using data cleaning and exploratory data analysis as examples. Steven also explains the process and gives clear instructions on how to optimize your Python code to use less resources and get more done.There is also talk about how to use decorators, list comprehensions, and generator expressions. When you mix functional programming techniques with Python's built-in support for object-oriented programming, you will get some interesting results.By the end of the book, you'll understand the basics of functional programming in Python and know when and where this way of thinking is most useful.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Functional Python Programming: Use a functional approach to write succinct, expressive, and efficient Python code, 3rd Edition"
"The book address ways that the benefits of functional programming accrue when we use these design patterns to build Python applications. It delves into the central features of the functional programming paradigm. It shows how to leverage immutable Python objects and how generator expressions adapt functional programming concepts to the Python language. It shows how you can use several built-in Python functions to operate on collections of data. This chapter will focus on several relatively simple functions, such as any() and all(), which reduce a collection of values to a single result. It examines the commonly used higher-order functions such as map() and filter(). It also shows many other higher-order functions and how we can create functions that work with or return functions.The book teaches how to design an algorithm using recursion and then optimize it into a high-performance for a loop. We’ll also look at other widely used reductions, including collections. It showcases many ways that we can use immutable tuples, and typing. NamedTuple, and the frozen @dataclass instead of stateful objects. It examines several functions in the itertools standard library module. This collection of functions simplifies writing programs that deal with collections or generator functions. It covers the combinatoric functions in the itertools module. It focuses on how to use some of the functions in the functools module for functional programming. It covers the toolz package and a number of closely related modules that help us write functional programs in Python. The toolz modules parallel the built-in itertools and functools modules, providing alternatives that are often more sophisticated and make better use of curried functions.Finally, the book covers how we can look at a decorator as a way to build a composite function. While there is considerable flexibility here, there are also some conceptual limitations. It examines some of the features of the PyMonad library. The futures modules point out an essential consequence of good functional design: we can distribute the processing workload. Using immutable objects means that we can’t corrupt an object because of poorly synchronized write operations.In the end, the book shows how we can think of web services as a nested collection of functions that transform a request into a reply. We’ll see ways to leverage functional programming concepts for building responsive, dynamic web content.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Functional Python Programming: Use a functional approach to write succinct, expressive, and efficient Python code, 3rd Edition"
"""Functional Python Programming"" is an excellent guide for Python developers looking to improve their coding skills by incorporating functional programming techniques into their work.

"As a long-time fan of Colt DA revolvers, I ponied up the 65 bucks for the book, and overall I'm pleased with it.  You must understand, though, that this is mostly a (gorgeous) picture book.  Chapter One is prose and contains a brief history of the Python, the various calibers (real and legendary), and descriptions of the many variations.  One of the best features of the chapter is a photo reprint of an article by the Colt employee who built the first Python (as told to none other than Massad Ayoob!), which seems to dispel the old idea the gun derived from King Custom modifications to the venerable Officer's Model. The remaining chapters are pictures of the variations of the gun:  blue Pythons, nickel Pythons, SS Pythons, limited edition Pythons, and so on.  There are also photographs of old Colt catalogs and price lists (the Python was not the most expensive Colt DA for quite awhile:  the SAA was).  Brown provides a new and improved serial number/date list (though he labels it ""approximate""). So why not 5 stars?  I would like to have seen Chapter One longer and more thorough.  What makes the Python so different from the other Colt DA revolvers?  What is Colt Blue vs. Royal Blue?  What about the supposed timing problems with the Python?  Why was it discontinued, since there seems to be a strong and affluent fan base?  And, will it ever come back? One thing I should mention:  you get your very own cutout of a  6"" Python, engraved, ivory grips as a bookmark.  That's as close to a high-grade Python as most of us will ever get.

"I don't know who Debbie Gibson and Tiffany think they are, or were, but I bought this movie for the snakes and gators, not them.  In truth, I have no idea what their claim to fame is, or was, and I don't care.  As billed, they were co-producers of this venture, co-stars, and obviously codependent (I don't think either of them wanted to look this stupid on their own, misery loves company).  The plot is perversely idiotic, an obnoxious animal activist, claiming to be a doctor (Debbie Gibson), steals and releases snakes in the Florida Everglades (with some savage repercussions).  By the time ranger Tiffany moseyed into this derelict plot I began to assume this was meant to be a comedy of small proportions.  Bubba the dog gets eaten.  The gun crazy local yokels are only too happy to switch from gator hunting to python hunting.  A guy gallantly runs a snake over with his pickup (chivalry is not dead or dormant).  By the time they started lacing chickens with steroids and feeding them to the gators, I was hooked.  This is an incredibly crappy movie that  manages to be quite funny in spite of the two leads trying against insurmountable odds and no talent to make this into a parody of all the other BIG gator-snake-shark type movies they don't want to be associated with.  And then Micky Dolenz shows up as himself (type casting).They probably thought this was a really cute idea teaming these two ladies.  But too much relies on knowing who these two would-be warbles are and why it should be funny to see them involved in an adolescent food fight.  Regardless, it's still oddly entertaining in a bus wreck sort of way.  (It seems rather obvious to say this is a bad movie but I feel it's almost a duty to mention it anyway.)

Steroids pumping up both creatures, getting them all angry...so much anger that I doubt group therapy anger management classes can cure. What can get more entertaining than this? Of course, you, dear movie-go-er, are still blessed with truly dramatic, point-out-the-obvious (""He was eaten by a gator!""), jokes so bad that they are hilarious, so much carnage that the characters are like ""oh another dude got eaten, oh well, let me have a beer,"" adequately terrible CGI, obliviousness, and oh, yes, what is a terribly awful glorious movie without blowing up gigantic critters mixed with a hot skinny blonde dressed in skimpy clothing?

"It is not a really a bad book. It does tell something about Python and does have examples, but it have a number  of weaknesses that make this book hardly useful for the majority of prospective buyers given that there are many  better books in all aspects.First, it is a very incomplete treatment of Python with a rather arbitrary selected subset of topics present. For examples, almost nothing about text processing that is Python very important strengths. Not even a chapter on strings. Second, the treatment of topics is very terse, every new concept is illustrated by very few examples, usually one, that frequently shows only one aspect to it. That keeps the book very small, but I am not sure it is a benefit. Third, all examples are illustrative - they show how concepts work. There are no larger examples that show meaningful programs demonstrating how Python could be used for solving problems. This kind of larger examples is a cornerstone of any good programming course, especially for beginners. Finally, the mechanics of Python interpretation, the deal with references, parameter passing, etc. that are critical to understand how Python works and how it is different from languages like Java or C# - not even presented. Due to issues 2 and 3, it is not a good book for beginners. Too terse, too few examples. It is still a reasonable book for those who know well 2-3 languages and want to see what Python does, but for the reason 1 and 4 it is not doing a good service for these readers as well.  Well, if you know 2-3 languages and need just a quick glimpse of what Python is - and the price for Kindle is just right for that. For all other reasons, seek a different book.I think, it is a good start that could be extended into a really good book, it is just so far only 1/2 of this good book, maybe 1/3.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Programming for Beginners: An Introduction to the Python Computer Language and Computer Programming (Python, Python 3, Python Tutorial)"

For those that have never written any code...this should still be pretty easy for you.  The coding examples are straightforward.As with any book on language syntax, there is errata in this one.  Unlike other people who complain about errata in text books like this one, I don't.  Debugging is part of code-writing.  It's hard for new people today, just as it was hard on new people when I first start writing code almost 30 years ago.  It is monumentally frustrating if you're new, but it's the price you must pay if you want to learn this skill.Don't be discouraged with the book's errata, or your own mistakes.  Part of your learning curve is understanding what the interpreters error messages mean when you execute your scripts.The author walks you through installation (for Windows, Mac, and Linux), modifying your path variable (don't worry if you don't know what that is), and executing simple scripts.If you're completely new to coding, or have lots of experience, this is a great intro to the basics of Python.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Programming for Beginners: An Introduction to the Python Computer Language and Computer Programming (Python, Python 3, Python Tutorial)"

I found the way he covered the chain rule and differentiating compositions of functions a bit lacking, however. He doesn't ever mention Jacobians and makes it more confusing than he needs to. The chain rule for composition of multivariate functions is not difficult when using Jacobians--you just need to multiply a chain of Jacobians in the correct order. He doesn't use this machinery, and has to sum some of his derivatives over columns because he doesn't define his derivatives in an intuitive way, using Jacobians.

It does a pretty good job explaining how AI/ML work, but a poor job of explaining new concepts he introduces. My main issue with the book is it does a fairly poor job of creating abstractions for the concepts learned, and requires that you keep quite a lot in your head.True to the title, it is mostly from scratch, although it does do matrix operations with numpy, which is the only sane option in my opinion.

Very informative,5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning from Scratch: Building with Python from First Principles
The first chapter starts off alright but he often fails to explain himself or provide the full code. He also does not give you any intuition as to why it works like he says he will. He goes through a series of mathematical functions applied to some input step by step without saying at each step why this works. When I got to the second chapter and he starts referencing a jupyter notebook with code not in the book and importing sklearn datasets that's when I decided to leave a review. He mentions briefly that discussion of data is a topic for the future. I think data and neural networks are not separable. There's no point in a neural network without data so if you write a future book please be complete.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning from Scratch: Building with Python from First Principles

"This is a very useful book for those who want to focus on feature engineering in their daily work. If you want you can use the Feature-Engine library which the author has created but if you wanted to understand how to improve your model performance, this is a must have book. I will highlight some of the best features of this book here:1. Imputing, encoding and Transforming features with Feature-Engine is very easy. You get to use a very simple and consistent syntax to perform these steps.2. Extracting features from date-time, text and time series data is very easy with the tools given in this book3. Finally creating new features such as splines, polynomials and periodic features is made easy.What is missing in this book is feature selection though it is covered in the feature-engine library. That’s probably a task and a book for another day. However this book comprehensively covers the large gamut of feature engineering techniques and is a great cookbook to that you can use from day one.

"This book covers a variety of feature engineering techniques for machine learning students, practitioners, and professionals. As a ""Cookbook"", the manual surveys data transformations that a user might like to perform in order to generate numerical features from numerical, categorial, text, or other sorts of data, and presents the core software libraries and functions that implement those transformations. Each chapter has a straight-to-the-point structure: technical requirements for the datasets, python libraries, and core functions used in the chapter's exercises, followed by a ""How to do it"" section with easy-to-follow python code, followed by a ""How it works"" section describing the techniques at a more conceptual level.The book covers a number of advanced topics that are of interest to a variety of users, including Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), Yeo-Johnson transformation, and decision-tree discretization/feature combinations. The suite of tools provided by the `feature-engine` library seems tremendously useful for wrapping many of these methods into easy-to-use routines. Some feature normalization techniques like Mahalanobis/ZCA or ICA whitening are surprisingly not covered. The cursory discussion of frequency-domain data representations makes some sense given the authors' focus on nonperiodic variables like debt and stock prices, but some coverage of these techniques would have been nice, as would a discussion of e.g. deep learning for feature induction.Although outside the scope of a cookbook like this, it would have been useful to see some discussion of benefits and drawbacks to each method, especially from the point of view of their relation to inferential statistics, else how train/validation/test routines might need to be adapted to features obtained through such imputation/transformation.

"After reading Packt's Python Feature Engineering Cookbook over the past couple of weeks, there was so much that I've been able to learn when it comes to preparing data and creating new features to aid in both the machine learning and data analysis process. The 3 main things that have been tremendously helpful in my daily workflow are:1. Learning better techniques for working with outliers and the impact they can have on your data. The valuable skills I've been able to detect here revolve around how to identify said outliers utilizing variable discretization.2. Extracting additional features out of both date and time to create new metrics for machine learning and analysis.3. Seeing how imputing missing data is significant and what are some of the best ways to do such.Overall, this book has been tremendous thus far and I've been fortunate to apply some of the new things I've learned to my daily workflow and increase productivity.#featureengineering #machinelearning #python #datascience #cleancode #optimization",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Feature Engineering Cookbook: Over 70 recipes for creating, engineering, and transforming features to build machine learning models, 2nd Edition"

"The book's subtitle, ""Best Practices for Development"" is misleading at best.

Why the authors wasted a whole chapter (Chapter 1) on ""Picking an Interpreter"" and another (Chapter 2) on ""Properly Installing Python"" is beyond me. If you are buying a book that is supposedly on Python best practices, you've probably already picked and installed an interpreter. Or several. Similarly unnecessary, Chapter 3: ""Your Development Environment,"" boils down to lists of text editors, IDEs, and tools.

Remember it longer.Edition number: (1)Media type: ebookCopy type: KindleISBN number(s): 1974431479 9781974431472My reviewTo what extent did I read and/or study this book?I read the entire book and completed nearly all of the practice exercises; however, I didn’t look at any of the appendices (because I don’t need to).What fields, subjects, and topics does this book cover?It covers most of the essential functions and methods of the Python (3) computer language.What fields, subjects, and topics does this book NOT cover?This ebook does NOT include any:• programming theory (even absolute-beginner theory)• in-depth explanations or examples• comparisons with other languagesHowever, none of the above limitations are a negative criticism of the book; they merely define the book’s scope.What is the overall tone of the author’s writing style?All of the explanations are very straightforward, in the sense that they aren’t cluttered with excessive and unnecessary academic language. Most of the chapters use a tone where the author is “talking down” to a beginning-level reader, but the language is never disrespectful, condescending, or silly. The author is (presumably) assuming that the reader doesn’t know anything about Python and therefore requires simple and relatable explanations.What did I like about this book?I love that this ebook comes with a complete set of practice exercises for each chapter that are extremely well-made and maintained, and don’t require any additional expense to use. In my opinion, every single technical ebook should include similar practice exercises and problems (to the extent that the evaluation of answers can be automated). Most of the learning process for computer languages is nothing more than memorizing the names and syntax of methods, and the only way to solidify memories is through repetitive practice.I also love how thorough and organized the content is, relative to the beginner-level scope. Everything a Python novice needs to get started is included, and is presented in a reasonably logical order.What did I NOT like about this book?I was sometimes mildly annoyed that a small number of the practice exercises didn’t parse correctly, and the checker stubbornly insisted that my answers were incorrect (even when I cut and pasted the correct answer). However, nothing is graded and it’s perfectly easy to skip any of the exercises, so minor glitches aren’t worth fussing over.Most of time, when I got the answers wrong, it was my fault, so I can only blame myself for not taking the time to carefully think through the exercise. However, there are some instances where the expected answer is unusually specific, so there’s a little bit of guesswork involved in determining what is expected, even when those precise expectations aren’t always explicitly stated.My conclusionsWas reading and/or studying this book worthwhile for me?Completing all of the exercises for this ebook was one of the most helpful and enjoyable self-teaching experiences I’ve ever had, and I’ve tried many of the available online courses for Python. I wish there were a lot more books like this, especially for computer-parsable subjects like math.Would I recommend this book to others?If you already have a vague idea of what a computer program does and how it works, and just want to dive into learning Python, this ebook and the associated practice exercises are the perfect way to begin.What additional materials will others need to make use of this book?Toward the end of the ebook, you’ll need to start coding small programs on your own computer (rather than using the web portal), but the ebook provides the necessary information.It also helps to have the official Python documentation website open at all times, as a reference. Everything you need to know about the language is there, including some tutorials.My ratings (0.0-5.0)Quality of content: 5Quality of writing: 5Quality of editing: 5Value to myself: 5Potential value to others: 5Review-document metadataInitial completion date: 220401Review version and revision: V1R0Template version and revision: V1R2",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster.

"*edit, Feb 2022: This book helped me get my dream job (technical writer with a basic grasp of code). I do think it's worth supplementing with external exercises (potentially even app authoring), and I still think the author should develop a few select explanations in later chapters. That said, I consider this a strong, digestible resource with effective reinforcement.Original review, Nov 2021:I first started learning Python with a different book. While the material is accurate, it's also a bit dense. The intent seemed to be for the reader to automatically memorize everything that was written as soon as it was read. While I don't mind intensive study, it felt like a failure of expectation setting; the book is billed as a fast way to learn. It's not. I shelved it towards the end, when the fundamentals supposedly came together. There wasn't enough reinforcement of prior lessons, not enough practical/digestible examples for the material to sink in.I gave A Smarter Way to Learn Python a bash, and I'm happy to report I got through it in about a month of steady study. I could skip the odd day or two and be fine, since the exercises led to better retention. I remembered fundamentals from earlier chapters because they kept being used in later exercises. For example, the last set of exercises reuses fundamental math operators discussed in the first few chapters. I also appreciated the UX of the exercises; you can mark an answer as correct if you feel like you got credit (or enough of it right to pass), and you can mark others as trivial if you're ready to move on.A couple parts are glossed over too quickly for me. For instance, in Chapter 55 (about Classes), the author says the reason why you duplicate an attribute name after def __init__ is something the reader can explain to him when they're teaching at Stanford. While I respect honesty about one's limitations, this wasn't the best time for it. Part of the disappointment is that the author generally explains things in clear and digestible ways. As a consequence, the rare exceptions stand out in stark relief. If the author is wiling/able to clarify this in a future revision, that would be most welcome.Overall, I quite enjoyed the material and generally recommend it. My only tips are to a) take notes as you go (a Google Doc would be fine), and b) to use a robust IDE when the author asks you to use IDLE. VS Code with the Pylance extension is more than adequate, it more closely fits the kinds of editors in common use nowadays, and it's free.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster.

"I think that the short chapters are a double edged sword of sorts. Great, you read for very little time and have a few facts on the code and syntax fresh and ready for the exercises immediately after reading. Not so great, the author throws curveballs about some stuff and concepts that he didn't go over in the chapters. The author also has a way of posing the questions in a way that can induce the person doing the exercises to wonder what it is that he wants as an answer. I find it interesting that early on in the studies ""exercises"" he flashes a message about not quitting early on in one's programming studies and that, a person can get very upset at how he poorly poses some of these questions and seems to toss in material not gone over in these ""short"" chapters. I feel that he should be going over everything that he may test you on in the chapters and make them longer instead of surprising and confusing people with stuff posed in questions and answers which, strongly seem to indicate that he ""wants"" you to get stuff wrong and ""find"" new concepts in the answers as you get them wrong. This system seems engineered more to piss people off and encourage them to quit than to keep on with it. Further, I don't see how the ""retention"" is going to remain intact for long. He tosses something into questions from the previous chapter with little warning and, I have already forgotten it enough to get it wrong. Often, I feel that things are implied in the questions too often as though, we know everything he knows and, I find it massively frustrating to answer correctly with syntax only to find that my answer is being accused of being wrong. Lot of flaws in this system and I feel that this author or, the authors have some work to do to develop this into its best possible form. I would most strongly advise against signing up for any course the author advises you to take for purpose of getting a job which, ""uses his / their system"" since, this doesn't at all seem to have a real ability to get people into a programming language retained and usable state of being any faster than any other method. You'll be throwing more money away to take a course using this method than you will with simply buying one of these books. Forget about all of the talk about the 400% retention rate crap. What you go over briefly and, don't use consistently is NOT going to remain in your memory long enough to be of value. When he does go over things properly in his chapters and doesn't surprise with unsuspected elements inserted into questions, I do fine and get mostly correct answers. When he is posing questions in his implying manner and combining that with extra material not gone over in the chapters, I am getting many more questions wrong and becoming exasperated. Just another slick ""system"" to get your cash is my judgement until, they can develop this into something real.",3.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster.

"Myers actually does offer a better way to learn programming.  I found his HTML book to be the clearest of all the HTML books I tried. So when I took up Python, I bought Myers' book on Python.  He  clearly and simply explains and demonstrates each step in a short chapter, then there are interactive exercises at the end of the  chapter.The teaching method is excellent, with clear step-by-step explanations and online practice exercises.  Even where the concepts are familiar, it's good to get the practice so the nuances of a new language can soak in.  The problem is the typos.  Sometimes he leaves out a key term or puts the wrong word in his code examples.  I caught one such error in an early chapter, where I easily spotted the inconsistency with his other code examples.  Sorry I can't be more specific, since it wasn't like I could stick a post-it note in the page of the Kindle book.  But now that I'm in unfamiliar territory (chapter 68, dealing with CSV files), it was a lot harder to recognize that had used inconsistent names for the same variable ""reader_of_f"" in line 2 and ""contents_of_f"" in line 4.  Maybe the time it took me to dissect the sample code and discover the error has contributed to my comprehension of the subject, but I don't think it's the kind of pedagogy we want.I thought the chapters might be a little too repetitious for simple concepts.  I've done a bit of programming in the Arduino IDE, and  Python looks similar enough that I was sailing through the book and thinking it was a cinch.  When I stopped long enough to do some of the interactive exercises, however, I found that I needed to pay attention to practical items like where to put the parentheses, quotes, and punctuation.  It's like the difference between being able to understand a foreign language and being able to speak it.  So go ahead and skim through a chapter if you think you already understand it, but do enough of the interactive exercises to be sure that your confidence is justified and and that you can put the concepts into practice.",4.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster.

"My reviews of Mark's other books will show I am a very enthusiastic customer. Have gotten the Kindle editions of his HTML/CSS, JavaScript and now his Python book (all very inexpensively, I might add). This is the the best way to learn the basic, underlying mechanics of a programming language, because you are constantly practicing it all the way through, with short, seemingly simple chapters, that especially at first seem a little too easy. But this is how you commit it to memory and make sure you are understanding how it works beyond surface syntax once things get a little more complicated.As I've noted I worked through several of Mark's books, the only one I haven't yet tackled is his  jQuery book. I'm still inexperienced enough though to not be sure if the reason this book seemed a little less in depth on its subject compared to the JavaScript book is due to his books or due to differences between the languages being covered. Maybe JavaScript is just more complicated to learn? Or maybe Python seemed a little easier to me as I have learned several different languages at this point (having also previously learned PHP through another online source and JavaScript being the first programming language I learned after coming back after long break from first learning programming back in technical school in the early 2000's), so am unsure if just my perception has changed as to how hard it was to learn thus affecting how I view the book when reviewing?Either way, I'm still convinced this is the best way to get started in a language, then you have a great, firm foundation on which to base further, more in depth learning of a language to use in a career in the future. I should also mention, there were some errors/glitches in the exercises and in the book, but Mark gives you easy opportunity to contact him telling him where the issues exist. He always responds and acknowledges that he's heard your report of the mistakes. Still I gave it five stars as it's a great way to learn.

"I've struggled for years to learn a coding language, and most people I knew that knew how to code would tell me to read this or that online, or give me a bunch of books to read, but I didn't know where to start and frankly, it left me intimidated by the process and I'd procrastinate my way out of doing it.  I could make sense of scripts that had already been written, but couldn't write something on my own to save myself.  My learning style needs a question to answer, the more specific the better, and ""how do I code?"" is just too general a question.After recently spending a few months unemployed and being asked in nearly every phone interview if I had any coding skills, I decided I needed to face the music and find a way to learn this stuff, even if it meant taking a class at a local college.  Python came up a lot, so that's where I headed.  I tripped over this book completely by accident, and while the bit about ""taught 50,000 people how to code, even grandmothers"" made me think it was BS, I bought it anyway.  I'm only 10 chapters in, and I have to say I love the way this book teaches.If you've already got some level of proficiency in Python, this isn't for you.  If you're trying to learn a new skill, or even just have a very basic understanding of coding, this breaks it down for you and the (free) online practice is excellent.  The author begins by telling you to not to spend too much time on it (25 minutes a session max) and don't pressure yourself, and then starts teaching with a lesson less than a page long.So far, it's working.

"What sets ""A Smarter Way to Learn Python"" apart from other books is that it compels you to immediately practice what you've learned.  The chapters are *extremely* short and encompass one primary topic.  You then drill that one topic with a series of online questions.  The questions always follow the same format asking you the same sorts of questions in different ways.  An analogy would be trying to learn names from pictures:  you could look at a list of names and match up the pictures or your could look at the pictures and match up the names.  In both cases you're doing the same thing, but because you've changed the way in which you do it, you learn it a little more thoroughly.  The online questions for the book operate in the same fashion.I don't expect to be a Python expert by the time I complete the book, but I do find it to be a relatively engaging way to absorb the material.  It's not the only tool one would need to learn the language but it's one tool.I recommend the book for getting started with this language.  A nice bonus is that you don't have to get bogged down in installing a Python editor or anything on your computer.  Everything happens through the website so it helps you determine if you want to go further with it.  One final thing to recommend it is that if you want to learn it in little chunks, you can.  Each chapter plus online exercises will take you five minutes or so.  Unlike the chapters in most other books which will take you much longer, you can pick up and put down this one throughout the day.  That aspect works well for me.  The drawback is that you're clearly not getting the full depth of the material, but what you do learn, you learn pretty well.  Again, this goes back to the notion that you're not going to be an expert upon completion, but you should know enough that if you want to become an expert, you can.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster.

"I've just started to learn to code in general and had started with codecademy.com learning Python. While codecademy is wonderful, I quickly found myself forgetting certain characters to include and felt like I needed a physical reference for me to be able to be successful. Interesting enough, on my search for ""Best"" Python training guides and books I came across this. Being as I felt I still wanted a physical copy (just something about a book in your hands makes it real), I ordered the paperback version.  That leads me to this. I didn't quite realize just how much more helpful this book was going to be! I decided to set aside codecademy for a moment and catch up with the book. This was a great idea. At least for me. This is why. When I was a kid I struggled with Algebra because of all the rules you just had to take at face value and the ""why"" seemed to always be missing. I grew to love physics, because the entire goal of physics is to explain ""How?"" and ""Why?"". I know this seems like a tangent but I have a point. If you are like me and need to know how and why a thing works so you can understand it inside and out or if you have struggled with following seemingly arbitrary rules ( of course they aren't arbitrary, it can just seem like that early on) then this book is fantastic.Mark spends time helping you to understand all the pieces in a very clear way so that way you understand them fundamentally and makes it easier to remember to do things the right way because you know why it should be.  Don't get me wrong here, I fully plan on heading back over to codecademy and other free sources, in fact, I'm excited too, but this is helping me grasp my first coding language so I CAN enjoy and thrive with those other sources.While I am not all the way through this book I feel like I am already moving at a great pace while really grasping what I'm doing in a far more constructive way that will really help build my foundation. This is proving to be worth every penny!",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster. Remember it longer.
"For years, I have been avoiding the drudgery of learning another programming language. If you have been doing the same, then may I suggest that you try this method. You don't have much to lose.NOTE: When I clicked on the link in the Kindle edition I was re-directed. Ensure that the link displayed in the Kindle is what actually appears in the browser before registering or you may register for the wrong programming language.Update: I have gone through 82% of the book and had to change my review to four stars instead of five, which means I still recommend it highly. I took one star off for two reasons;1) The author REALLY emphasizes learning by doing much more than understanding. This is arguably the best approach to get you coding fast. So, on two occasions so far he would say something to the effect that ... he does not know why and if you find out you can write him and let him know. Since I like to know why, I had to refer to other books. So depending on your personality, you may have to refer to other texts, which is not unusual when you are learning.2) There are some errors. Mostly you will realize these are errors when you start to do the exercises and or refer to other texts, so look out for them. Unfortunately most Python texts are terse and dry so I will not recommend others at this time but if I have a change of heart I’ll review them so you can watch my reviews.All in all a stellar effort and I wished I could have given it 4.3 stars but Amazon does not allow for that. If you can't learn Python with this then I have NO idea what advice to give.

I've had the book for a couple of months now, while being a full time student and I still have not gone through the entire book (I have read it through fully but haven't gotten around to study it) I have learned very good tips and tricks from the book which helped me a lot in my CS classes and sometimes I would even surprise my professors and I recommended this book to many of my classmates (only 2 of them got it and they loved it), in general this is a very good resource to get your through CS and become someone that you want to be.

"I'm constantly on the lookout for new resources to share with my teams, which tend to be composed of folks from all kinds of backgrounds: formal CS, self-taught, code-camps, and other educational backgrounds (or even fields). Not everyone has the same level of math skills at the start, and some need refreshers from time to time.I had a chance to review Paul Orland's book and compare it to some other books on my shelf. This book doesn't try to be a rigorous first principles math book. It doesn't focus on trying to give you a deep dive on the math topics (e.g. looking at proofs and the like). It also isn't a book geared towards Computer Science specifically (no math topics on sets, logic, graph theory, complexity, combinatorics, etc).instead, it covers a selection of topics of interest to programmers/developers, delivered in three parts/areas: 1) 2/3D math (particular linear algebra techniques for doing various matrix calculations), but then applying to higher dimensions, 2) Basic Calculus techniques for simple physical simulation and Fourier analysis, and 3) a light intro into some useful techniques frequently found in Machine Learning applications.What I like is that is focuses on explaining enough of these math topics you can get the gist, and more importantly, how to think about these technique and translate to programming (in Python, here). After reading it, I took away an appreciation of how to apply some new (old) tools to practical problems at hand (e.g. fitting functions to data, basic classifiers, etc)For my team mates who have very little math background, they may need a little help, and online resources (like Khan Academy) are good supplements. This is not ""dumbed down"" content, it still takes some study. It is approachable though.For folks who remember their geometry, algebra, trig, and basic calc, but haven't really had to apply it to programming, this will be informative on how to think about certain kinds of problems and implement certain algorithms in the event that what they are looking for isn't immediately found in the language of choice's math or other libraries.Overall, a worthwhile read if you want to refresh on math as a developer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Math for Programmers: 3D graphics, machine learning, and simulations with Python"
"I found this book to have really excellent coverage of a number of important topics in math. Often programmers, even ones with a lot of experience, have become a little distanced from the kinds of math which drives a lot of modern tech - computer graphics, optimization, machine learning etc. A decent appreciation for the math underpinning these can open a LOT of doors for those who've become a little stuck with more dull or mundane programming tasks, but the problem is how to acquire (or refresh) these skills. Math courses online can cover the ground eventually, but there are a lot of areas to know about and finding the right relevance or level of detail is hard. The author of this book really hit the mark for me, and the fact that every concept is illustrated in code makes the knowledge transfer significantly easier. Some of the stuff was definitely stuff I knew but had forgotten or hadn't used in a while (matrices, dot and cross products, calculus), other was familiar but I'd never applied it (Fourier series), and some was completely new. The book doesn't pretend to give an encyclopedic  coverage of math, neither does it make claims about depth for the concepts it does cover, but it DOES give more than enough to get you right into the subject with a minimum of effort and in a really engaging way.Regarding programming knowledge, I think you do need some to get the most of it, though it doesn't need to be in Python - the book is for programmers after all.I'd thoroughly recommend it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Math for Programmers: 3D graphics, machine learning, and simulations with Python"

"As someone who has all the Flying Circus episodes on DVD, who owns ""All the Words"" and the script to ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" I was most pleased when my daughter sent me ""The Pythons"" as a gift from my daughter a few years back. I've read this book through a couple times and some parts more than that, and I've been rewarded with a glimpse of the background and the life of the men who made the series so memorable. In this book we read of the youth and education of the young Pythons in Great Britain after the Second World War, as well as their experiences in the British university system. And we learn how they met each other, their pre-Python days on the BBC, and the years when they produced the memorable Flying Circus episodes as well as their movies.While the book has its humorous moments, it's not all laughter. For it is a truly unvarnished account, one that includes the tragic story of Graham Chapman's heavy drinking and early death. One cannot read this book without gaining an appreciation for the genius of these men as well as an understanding of the struggles each one of them has encountered along the way.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Pythons' Autobiography By The Pythons
"...but that's not a bad thing (explanation below).I got this book for Christmas and was concerned that because of it's size I would probably end up just thumbing through and reading select parts.  Not the case.  I started reading it and couldn't stop.It covers the group and individuals from their pre-Python lives through discussions of working together again after The Live at Aspen event - though I won't tell you what conclusion they came to.  In between is chock full of every detail about their influences, TV show, the movies, the stage shows and more.  And because each member contributes (hence...autobiography) you get a great insider's perspective on the dynamics of the group.  You learn first hand who doesn't like who, what they enjoyed and how, at times, they really struggled, and a bunch more behind the scenes insights into their personalities.I found the book to be fascinating.  It is formatted such that each event is discussed by multiple members of the troop.  So you get a 360 degree view of their writing sessions, their fights, their good times, their movie productions, their business and artistic relationships.The only downside (and here is why I titled this as such) is that it was rarely funny.  That is by no means a fault, but could come as a surprise (as it did me) to the reader who expects it to be silly and funny like their performances.  As a result this book is probably only going to be of interest to a true Python fan.  And a true Python fan will find it indispensible.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Pythons' Autobiography By The Pythons
"The Pythons were like the British Marx Brothers, Anti-authority,subversive, surreal, and very very funny.

On a different note, in his autobiography part of the book Eric Idle seems too proud of his anti-authority stances. The 60's are very long gone now. Idle should grow up and not be so flaunting of his anti-societial ways. Being part of society is back in fashion.",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Pythons' Autobiography By The Pythons
"I well remember the impact of Monty Python's Flying Circus arrival on TV with its sense of anarchy and ""what on earth  is going to happen next"". Of course, as a teenager, the cleverness largely went over my head; I would certainly not have understood the Descartes reference in ""There is no point of contact between the extended and the unextended"". I did however seem to get  to learn everything off by heart.Monty Python started in 1969, just as The Beatles were calling it a day, and it was interesting to read in this book that George Harrison was a huge fan who thought that they had picked up and run with the spirit of The Fab Four.This book does not provide lots of detail about the sketches and films made by this fab 6. Rather, it provides a real insight into the internal dynamics of the team of Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese and Terry Gilliam. For the most part it all seems amazingly harmonious and focused, but tensions between certain members are not skirted over.The success of the book for me lies in the fact that each member's distinct character is quite clear. So, Michael Palin is the most accommodating, John Cleese the most obsessive about detail, Terry Jones the most organised etc.So if you want to know what it was like for the individuals who made up Monty Python, this book is for you. If you want to know about the details of specific sketches, these are largely absent, so you wont get what you want.For me, I got exactly what I wanted and loved every page.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Pythons' Autobiography By The Pythons
"The first thing I should warn potential buyers about is the size and weight of this book if you buy the hardcover edition. I did not realise that something weighing marginally less than a slab of marble would eventually be trying to make its way through my letterbox. The hardcover edition of this book is for only the sturdiest of bookshelves and the beefiest of arms. In short; it is not a tome to be read in the bath.However, once you have decided whether or not obscenely large books are for you, I would definitely recommend this one. It is one of the more interesting books about the Pythons because it is actually written by them; hence the title. All of the Python's, bar Graham as he is conveniently dead, have written a few pages about their childhood and first forays into comedy, culminating in the formation of Monty Python. I found it incredibly fascinating to learn about the different backgrounds they each came from and the circumstances which eventually brought them all together.In between the mini autobiographies are lusciously printed photographs spanning their entire career; taken on their film sets and various live performances among other locations. They really help to bring alive the Python's descriptions of their experiences of making their TV show and subsequent films and live tours.

"The impressive book compiles parallel stories of the Monty Python's Flying circus comic group.  Each member of the ""club"" describes his experience, how he became a member, and how the group worked together to deliver its gags and films... The book is some kind of a mine of information on the Pythons' life and history, with many anecdotes and also many photos. However, contrary to what many readers could expect, it is not a funny book. Its purpose is not to make the reader laugh or smile. It is not either a true collective book. Instead, each member of the old team relates its memories of what happened. There is no true dialogue between the Pythons. What stroke me, as the major feature of the book, is that they had some difficulties to work together.  The confrontation between the two Terries is one aspect, another one is the drinking problem of Graham Chapman, but also the seriousness of John Cleese is worth mentionning...Finally, the feeling that comes out of the book is that the Pythons were quickly longing to split the team, because each one wanted a career of its own.  As early as at the end of the Holy Grail film, they were heading separate ways. By some standard, it is thus a rather sad and dull book on a terminated adventure, the heroes of which arguing on their own importance in the story.And now for something completely different...",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Pythons' Autobiography By The Pythons
"Within the “Scheduling” chapter they indicate that “of the 93% of the problems that we do understand… only 9% can be solved efficiently…” This appears to apply to much of the book regarding the various topics covered.  Often the treaties are interesting, but the solutions are often impractical, inapplicable, or outdated.Within the “Caching” chapter the authors make much about human memory and Media headlines both fading away very rapidly as time goes by.  They feel this forgetting pattern is part of an underlying universal principle.  It may be, but when you look at their own graphs (pg. 101) on the subject they omit to emphasize that the graphs have completely different scale on the x-axis.  What human beings forget in a matter of hours, the Media moves on in a matter of days.  It is a very different time scale that diminishes the insight associated with this principle besides the obvious: yes indeed individuals and even societies have a limited memory (on their own different respective scale).They are often not in tune with the information age.  For instance the algorithm that dominates the first half of the book is the 37% rule that you should stop gathering data regarding decisions after researching 37% of the data you were considering exploring.  This virtually applies to everything.  If you were planning to date 10 different people before getting married in order to “shop around” you apparently have enough info after dating the first 4.  If you are planning to rent an apartment the same is true (you have enough info to make a good choice after interviewing the first 4 applicants out of 10).  If you are planning to sell a house you can accept an offer after passing on the first few of them.  If you are recruiting and hiring a secretary the same principle holds up.However, with the online world we have so much more information than the world the author describes.  Regarding mating with numerous online websites one has so much more information and choices than what the 37% rule would suggest.  The same is true if you are hiring a secretary, you can just advertise on an online platform receive a 100 resumes in a few days.  Filter those resumes, interview just a few candidates, select the best one and be done with it.  This recruiting renders the 37% rule irrelevant (you don’t need to interview 37 candidates out of 100 since you already have a lot of info on all of them before interviewing them).Also, absent from the math the authors convey is the concept of supply and demand.  When selling a house, this transaction is dominated by the local supply and demand.  For instance, anyone who has sold a home during the housing crisis most probably did not have the luxury to wait out for better offers such as the 37% rule would suggest.  In general, waiting for a better offer does not work well in real estate.  A house number of days on the market is a measure of how stale a prospective home sale gets.  Waiting for better offers (37% rule) typically does not work.  That is why sellers remove their homes from the market to give them a fresh reset.Also absent from the authors’ calculations are moral considerations as they state: “if you are a skilled burglar and have a 90% chance of pulling off each robbery (and a 10% chance of losing it all [by being caught] ), then retire after 90/10 = 9 robberies.  Cool math but not exactly “Algorithms to Live By” as the title suggests.On other occasions, they do not support or explain the underlying math at all.  Such is the case for the Gittin Index they cover on page 39 to 42.  The latter is associated with counterintuitive results that remain confounding.Other algorithms appear flawed.  This includes the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm that supposedly guarantees minimal regret.  I am unclear how that would be the case because by selecting such an option you also take the maximum risk.  That’s what condo flippers did during the housing crisis Leveraging gets you up on the Upper Confidence Bound… but also the Lower one.The authors cover the most important subject Bayesian statistics within chapter 6.  However, their treatment of the subject focuses a lot more into challenging technical considerations like the probability distribution of the a priori events (Normal, Power, Erlang, etc.) rather than on explaining the basics of Bayes theorem.  Without establishing a good foundation explaining Bayes theorem any insights regarding a priori events distributions are rather obfuscating.  For a better coverage of Bayesian statistics Nate Silver’s “The Signal and the Noise” is a lot more edifying.Several of their chapters’ subjects and titles use confusing play on words that make them sound like they are relevant to your daily life but they really are not.  The chapter on “Relaxation” has nothing to do with relaxation.  It describes mathematicians removing technical math constraints from very challenging problems in order to being able to solve them.  The chapter on “Randomness” has also little to do with a layperson’s meaning of randomness.  Instead, it deals with technical math concepts regarding sampling, Monte Carlo simulation, and randomized algorithms.  Those represent another set of math strategies to solve what would be otherwise unresolvable problems.The book is not all bad.The chapter on “Overfitting” is excellent.  That’s even though it is still aimed at the math geek crowd and provides little in terms of “Algorithms to Live By.”  This book is truly very mistitled and mispecified in terms of audience target.  In this chapter, they warn against developing models associated with higher degree polynomials to better fit the curve of a given data set.  This is not just with higher degree polynomials but often any model that has a lot of variables that fit the history of the data really well.  Such complex models with many variables often do a worse job of predicting given new data vs. much simpler models that do not fit the learning sample of the model as well. Their referring to cross-validation to test for overfitting, regularization to preempt overfitting, and stepwise methods to build streamline models consists of interesting arcane math technicalities.  None of them have much relevance in your daily life decisions.The chapter on “Game Theory” is also excellent.  Their treatment of Game Theory is very good.  Additionally, their explanation of a specific Game Theory situation: Information Cascade is truly fascinating and for once most relevant.  It explains a whole lot about group behavior, asset bubbles, and related financial crises.  What others have often described as the “madness of crowds” to explain bubbles may be better explained by information cascades.  During the most recent financial crisis, each relevant party may have followed their own rational economic interest.  But, the whole economic sector was plagued by negative equilibria that lead to inevitable disasters.  This is a characteristic of information cascades as described within the book in the section “Information Cascades: The Tragic Rationality of Bubbles.”My rating reflects that there are only two excellent chapters out of 11, and most of the math content is not really relevant to your daily life.

"For me, the book takes intellectual effort to absorb. As I was preparing to write this review, I was further impressed with the range of information presented by the authors. I am personally undertaking an investigation of machine learning, artificial intelligence, data mining, etc; The book fit into this investigation. If you have interests in this area (or areas), I think you'll find the book useful.  It probably shouldn't have, but the parallels between common human problems and computer programming surprised me. As the book has had a large number of reviewers already, I will highlight some, but far from all, of the topics of each chapter so you may see if they make you curious. While the book speaks of algorithms to live by, the mathematics in the book is highly limited.Optimal stopping - how many people out of 100 possible candidates should one interview for a given position (including that of spouse)? 37%, Why? Read the book.The Explore/Exploit dichotomy - Should one ask the question ""What's new"" or ""What's best""? Your answer may depend on your time horizon. As your time horizon shortens, ""what's best"" may be the better question. The book explains why. The book also looks at the multi-armed bandit as an example of the explore/exploit dichotomy. What's a multi-armed bandit? Think of the one-armed bandit in Vegas and multiply its arms. Mathematicians do so. Their conclusions may be useful. The trials of music critics also fit into the explore/exploit dichotomy. The authors explain why music critics find exploration a chore.Sorting - libraries are the metaphor for computer sorting. Human memory also requires sorting. Maybe the decline in memory as humans age may be due to the amount of information through which it must sort and not due to declining faculties. A five-year old has a lot less information to go through than a seventy-five year old. The authors consider sorting techniques with email, Yelp, and other common uses. There is much useful information.Caching - when is forgetting necessary? According to the authors, the first computer cache was developed for a supercomputer in 1962 ub Manchester, England. I wonder how ""super"" that computer was? Caching allows some information to be stored for repetitive use and uncached information to be kept in the background.Scheduling - many scheduling problems have ""intractable"" solutions. The authors suggest different solutions based on algorithms such as precedence constraints, earliest due date (one I personally use frequently, which I couple with a personal likely to get me in the most trouble the quickest test) and shortest processing time.  The scheduling problem has received substantial effort from mathematicians.Bayes's Rule - how to use statistical inference to make useful predictions. Couple a well-defined problem with a range of prior outcomes and one can make accurate guesses. A .300 hitter comes to the plate against the same pitcher who has already struck the batter out twice and it may be a fair guess that the hitter is due for a hit.Overfitting - don't overthink and over complicate a problem. The authors advise against practicing the idolatry of data. A more complex theorem may well lead to less accuracy rather than more. On the level of incentive compensation, the authors quote Steve Jobs for being careful that you include only those elements in your incentive package that matter; you will get what you measure.Relaxatrion - the perfect is the enemy of the good. To get any useful answer from your mathematical model, it may be necessary to relax some of your constraints (insisting that your model never allow the traveling salesman to re-enter the same city twice may preclude any answer at all in a time period of less than the remaining life of the universe).Randomness - mathematicians sometimes realize that the best answer comes from sampling and not from strict calculations. This may explain why I get so many survey requests.  Algorithms for prime numbers use this technique. And, apparently, thousands of years ago the Greeks were already looking for prime numbers.Networking - here the authors examine the ""Byzantine generals"" problem, which plays a part in explaining how computers communicate with each other.Game Theory - Alan Turing investigated the ""halting problem"" in the 1930s. What if you give your computer a problem and it just keeps going?  Rock, paper, scissors is a game with which most are familiar. It, too, is part of game theory. When a game seems to have no satisfactory answer, maybe it's time to change the game. What happens when you have an ""information cascade""?If any ot this interests you, I believe that you will enjoy the book. I recommend it highly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions
"When one thinks of algorithms, it is often in association with computers or machines. Not humans. It is also common to think algorithms are there to provide a simple, neat solution to complex problems only a machine could solve. Or that algorithms can, once fed enough information, predict one’s every action and solve every problem. The main premise of Algorithms to Live By is to disabuse one of such notions. Algorithms to Live By explores how regular people use algorithms without even realizing it in their day-to-day lives. By doing so, the authors hope to destigmatize the word and get people to see the concept differently. Though the book can be dry at times, the authors manage to write a book that is accessible to most people. And there are moments of insight that do make the book a fascinating read.As aforementioned, the book explores how people use algorithms in their day-to-day to accomplish tasks. They focus on several elements: explore/exploit, or when it is best to continue to look for something better or make a choice from what one already knows; sorting and tradeoffs; and scheduling being among the subjects of focus. What makes these sections interesting is that they often talk about tradeoffs that one would seem counterintuitive. An example of this is in the scheduling section. The authors mention how the placement of a task on a schedule may be influenced by how much one knows about the task: by its duration or difficulty. This may increase the difficulty of scheduling if one were to know every detail of every task that must be done for the day. They also mention that while some may be tempted to schedule tasks based on how easy they are, this may also come with downsides. Especially if one decides to prioritize harder tasks before easier ones, only to realize that its completion requires completing an easier task. They give an example of a NASA Mars rover being frozen due to this fact. The rover was programmed to prioritize high priority tasks first in its queue over low priority tasks. However, one of the low-priority tasks kept being pulled from the bottom of the queue to the top. This caused the rover to freeze. Thus, even well-thought-out systems can lead to problems.The above example with NASA shows another aspect of the book I like; the use of real world examples. The authors tell stories involving real world mathematicians and scientists struggling with these issues in their personal lives. This helps make the subjects feel personal and applicable to one's own life. In fact, I would argue that the only issue with the book is that these anecdotes seem to be an afterthought. This is due to the fact that the anecdotes become more prominent as the book progresses towards the end. Thus, the first few chapters can be somewhat dry in its presentation which may turn off a lay reader. Furthermore, the use of hypothetical scenarios in the earlier chapters feel like a pale imitation of the personal anecdotes of later chapters.All in all, this book was fairly enjoyable. While having some rough patches, the authors did try and succeed in making an accessible book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions
"Despite being an East-coaster, I'm a member of the Long Now Foundation, which--when I'm asked to describe it--I usually say is like TED, but with a long term view and way better substance. The Long Now gives regular talks, and then puts those talks up in video and audio form for others, who couldn't be in attendance. I subscribe to the podcast in iTunes, and listen to it--along with other podcasts--on my way to and from work.A few months ago, Brian Christian was the guest speaker, and gave a talk centered around the subject matter of his latest book: Algorithms to Live By. The talk was fascinating, and contained a nice mixture of computer science, statistics, and humor to win the crowd over, and Christian managed to do so without coming across as too ""pop science.""I purchased the book that same week, and between juggling work responsibilities and twins, managed to carve out about an hour each night to read through it. There were chapters that held my interest, and chapters that didn't, but overall the book was a fantastic mix of how various computer science problems are also real work problems, and algorithms that solve one can be applied to the other as well.The first thing that catches you in the book is the discussion of optimal stopping, and how given a decision that needs to be made, you should begin making your choice after 37% of the options have been mulled over, assuming any of the next decisions/options are better than the ones that came before. This is illustrated with the secretary problem, and you can see why the authors led with this example not just in the book, but also in the Long Now talk. It seems both crazy and fascinating to have a difficult decision boiled down to such a hard percentage. The authors then go over different variations of the problem, and show how slight alteration can bring the best outcome.The authors (Christian and Tom Griffiths) then follow this up with a rapid succession of entertaining problems such as exploit/explore to determine whether you should go with something that you know, or try something new, as well as chapters on sorting, caching, and scheduling, giving messy desk people hope by showing that a stack of files on a desk where something searched for is retrieved and then placed on top of the pile will eventually result in the most optimized sorting methodology for the job, and reminding older, forgetful people that accumulation of knowledge can result in greater time to sift and retrieve that information, renaming so-called brain farts to caching misses.The chapter on Bayes' rule is where things start to get a little bogged down, but only in the beginning. Eventually, the chapter turns into an explanation on forecasting, showing which various predictive methodologies should be used for which various distributions--even equating the Erlang distribution to politics.The back half of the book isn't as tight or as entertaining as the parts that came before it, but overfitting was a great read to be perusing while Nate Silver was being hammered for his polling methodology in the most recent election, and the chapter on networking gave a great, easy-to-read introduction to how information networks differ from telephony. The authors then conclude the book with game theory, discussing the tragedy of the commons, and how, as a society, we could pursue better options in order to ensure mass participation in important initiatives.As somebody who studies and works in computer science and mathematics, I can say that casual readers will likely get lost in some sections, but powering through or re-reading will get you on to the more entertaining sections. This is a great book that works as a science popularizer without injecting fluffy prose/concepts or dumbing the material down.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions
"If I ever wrote a non-fiction book, there is no doubt I would make the first chapter the best. As so was the case here. The first chapter was about the 37% Decision Rule and it was really and usable. All the takeaways in the book are useful but technically, you can use any social or scientific theories and apply it to life. For example, economic theories are really relevant for everyday life, especially when making decisions. Maybe I should write a book. As the chapters went on, the theories got blander and blander.It is still an interesting read.

"I got the audio version of this book a year ago.  Every time I thought to dive in, I felt a mild quaking in my soul. Gah, this is gonna be so hard, I worried.  As a mere mortal without any background in computer science, advanced mathematics, logic, or statistics and risk, I feared my reach exceeded my ability to grasp.Well, I wasn’t 100% wrong.  It was hard.  However, I understood and I learned.  Yes, I hit replay dozens of times, but I got it.  (Of course, after I ran through the audio version twice, I ordered the book because I just had to have it in my library.)I did not expect the multidisciplinary palette from which the authors created this work.  While teaching me about optimization problems in computer science, I came better to understand mean-variance portfolio optimization, game theory, equilibrium strategies, and caching, just to name a very few.  This book has great depth.  Remarkably, it has even greater range.When examining the algorithmic dances that computers do nanosecond by nanosecond, we are also examining how we make decisions every day.  Should I stay on this jammed expressway?  How long should I wait for a table at my favorite eatery?  Is it better to do three small laundry loads per week or have one big laundry day? How should I best arrange all of these books on my shelves?  If you are like me, you have experienced that frustrating little circle, spinning and spinning, as your computer tries to wrest a result from the digital universe or just from your hard drive.  When you are waiting for a taxi or a train, you are experiencing a life-size version that little spinning circle.  When do you chalk it and look for Plan B?This book describes how computers solve their problems and at the same time it shows us how the problems computers solve are just like the ones we deal with and solve, day in and day out. This isn’t too shocking, since humans set up the computer decision-making trees in the first place.  Still, when I am synthesizing many possibilities, or struggling with family schedule optimization problems, I really can’t wait to apply terms like “simulated annealing” and “the price of anarchy”.At the end of the day, when my family members are all doing the equivalent of sticking a thumb drive in my ear and starting their respective downloads, instead of objecting with: “Wait a minute, one at a time, I have to think!”, it will bring me joy to say, “Don’t trigger a Bufferbloat,  guys, no one wants a Tail Drop.”Most fun fact I learned:“In contrast to the widely held view that less processing reduces accuracy, the study of heuristics shows that less information, computation, and time can in fact improve accuracy.”  My translation?  Don’t forget to ask grandma what she thinks, it’s likely to be spot on.I really loved this book.  It is one I will return to often.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions
"What a truly amazing book—it uses common computer design strategies and fixes to, practically and persuasively, illuminate human decision making.  It covers all sorts of tasks—making a call schedule, finding the best parking spot, managing children or adults who are challenge limits or are prone to ignore them, designing an auction process that rewards bidder honesty.  Note that not all these problems have ideal solutions, but it can identify the few that have a clearly preferable one, some that have workable strategies and others that are refractory to complex computer theory.  It even discusses randomness and how it adds richness to our creative lives and can, in moderation, enliven our choices.

"Not sure I understand many of the other reviews.  Yes, you can learn some Python by using this book but there are several issues with this book.  First off, it contains a fair number of typographical errors that you're going to have to catch, and resolve, on your own.  Second, and perhaps more important, the author does keep things pretty minimalist.  What I'm getting at is the book is less than 100 pages and the explanation of things is sometimes nonexistent.  For example, he introduces the Panda function but really provides no explanation for the purpose of the function before having you just start typing in code and using the function.  Basically you're left on your own to figure out a lot things  The title of this book implies that it's for beginners but, given the missing explanations, I don't think that's true.  I've been involved in the computer industry for several decades (some of which involved coding Windows in the C language) and studied a variety of languages including assembler, C, Cobol, Basic, Fortran, JavaScript, and some rudimentary Python programming.So far I haven't gotten to the part about machine learning but at this point I'm about halfway through the book.

My favorite is chapter 2, which is a step-by-step guide on exploring a data project, it's like having a professional guide you. I'm an experienced software developer, and I owe this book a lot for introducing me to many concepts. I'm old-school, so sitting down with a book and copying code examples takes me back and is a familiar experience. For some people, copy pasting might be more intuitive but you really can learn from doing things by hand. The full code is on github, but I recommend using it for reference only. What this book isn't, and doesn't pretend to be, is an introduction to Python.

This is hands down the best textbook I've ever bought! I never expected a data science text book to be easy to read but this book flows so well!, its easily digestible and it gives great examples with data that is easily available. You can write completely functional ML code from this book alone but one of the best features is that the book has GitHub site broken down chapter by chapter that helps fill the code out. If you are someone like me who hadn't had any experience with Matplotlib the github was super helpful because it covers in depth how to make really nice plots for the various models. I would recommend this book to anyone who is doing machine learning. The only thing I would change about this book is when it gets into decision trees, RF, various boosting types, XGB, as it moves through the models it only gives an example of the classification form of the model or the regression for of the model and I think it would be helpful if it gave examples for both for each model.

Sometimes he just forgets to put in a line of code.This book is free online I learned that after googling for the right code but still I prefer buying the book.

There are other books with that feature that gives kids instant gratification and success.This book is fantastic for a tween or teen who is motivated to learn coding by reading and doing activities suggested by the book. If never tells a person ""do this, now do that"". It is designed like a textbook. It gives an example, suggests the reader tries it, then assumes the person will experiment on their own to see what else they can do with the new knowledge.What would I like to see? After each example, it should give a mini challenge. ""Now that you've done that practice, modify the example to make it do ______ instead."" Perhaps put a series of hints on a section at the back of the book, ""go to page X to get a hint."" Then a solution section, ""if you need to see one way to do it, go to page X"".If I was teaching a middle school class with this book, I would give them a practice challenge after each book example.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Creative Coding in Python: 30+ Programming Projects in Art, Games, and More"
"As a computer science teacher, I have found that many of the coding books available for tweens and teens do not lead to long term learning of a programming language. These books typically have lots and lots of code that the reader uses to create projects, but the reader is often not learning the concepts behind the code and they are not able to transfer anything they have done to a new programming project.Creative Coding in Python is the answer to this problem and a fun and engaging way to learn to program in Python.Each chapter of Creative Coding in Python allows the reader to create a programming project like a chatbot or geometric art or interactive fiction or a game. The Big Ideas in each chapter provide foundational knowledge about programming concepts like variables, loops, lists, conditionals, functions, and more with short explanatory text and code that readers can try themselves. In addition to the explanatory text and code examples, readers are also presented with flowcharts or pseudocode of what they will be creating. This helps readers to build the good programming habits of thinking about the project they are creating and planning before programming. Once the Big Ideas are introduced, readers then create the main project for the chapter. While code is provided for the basic project, readers are also asked to improve the basic project in some way. Each chapter also has an Experiment and Extend section with more programming project ideas that can be created with the knowledge from the Big Ideas. Completing the projects in this section of each chapter reinforces the learning and provides the needed transfer of the concepts to new programming challenges.Parents: If you are looking for a book for your budding programmer who wants to truly learn an industry standard language, this would be a great book for your child. By reading, understanding, and completing the programming projects, your child will have a solid foundational knowledge of Python and some creative programming projects to show off, as well.Teachers: Do you have students that are ready to move on to text-based programming but the rest of your class isn’t ready yet? Creative Coding in Python would be a great addition to your classroom for those students. It is the latest addition to my classroom library. Beyond adding the book to your classroom library, this book and the companion website could be a great primer for you, as a teacher, if you would like to teach an introductory Python class to your students.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Creative Coding in Python: 30+ Programming Projects in Art, Games, and More"
"My daughter is nine, and we plowed through this book together over the Thanksgiving holiday. So many coding books for kids have too much orientation information up front and not enough ""roll your sleeves up"" and play content that will spark their interest immediately enough to hold them until they are invested. This book, though, was awesome. She started out building a chatbot, and although we were progressing through other content, she also kept going back to her chatbot ""Daisy"" to evolve it as she learned new things. She and I *loved* this book, as it helped us to play together creatively and learn Python at the same time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Creative Coding in Python: 30+ Programming Projects in Art, Games, and More"
"The other positive reviews are astounding and it's obvious people haven't seen other ""Python for Kids"" books on the market. Compared to all the others, even much older titles, this book is sparse and lacking in substance. Please don't waste your money on this title and buy another one such as ""Coding Games in Python"" (for a similar level of graphic design and cuteness) or something like ""Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python"", now in its 4th edition and with a level of depth about 10X higher than this ""Creative Coding"" title.First, the good about this book: the illustrations are sharp and the author goes through a checklist to give an introduction to most of the key coding concepts. It's just a ""check the box, yup, I covered that topic"" treatment, though, and there's ZERO depth. Check out the attached images that show the sections on Loops and Lists.Second, the bad:--Too much filler (out of 130 pages, there are 10 pages of section headers, another 20 where there's barely any text, only screenshots, and overall waaaay too much white space on each page). You could read all the actual words in this book in less than an hour.--Too little depth; no one could use this book successfully to teach cosing because if you don't know Python, you're not going to be able to help your child with just this book. If you *do* know Python already, you'll have to supplement so much that you might as well just make up your own course or use another book.BETTER ALTERNATIVES:I've gotten quite a collection of Python books over the years to teach my 4 kids. I've even done book reviews at my Learn Richly blog and I bought two recent books (this ""Creative Coding"" one and ""Coding Games in Python"") to freshen up my collection and compare the older books I have to these new titles.So, given all that, here are the better options:GRAPHICALLY RICH: ""Coding games in Python"" has the same level of beautiful color art as ""Creative Coding in Python"" but has 210 pages instead of 130 and then puts 2X the information on each page. It gives TONS of coding examples and then tells you what each piece of code does. It's by FAR better than ""Creative Coding"". It was just published in late 2018.DEEP AND USEFUL:While not as colorful as the two recent books, there are two older titles I highly recommend if you actually want your child to lear Python:""Teach Your Kids to Code"" by Dr. Bryson PayneOR""Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python"" by Al SweigartEither of the above will help kids or beginner adults to actually learn the theory and practical use of Python.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Creative Coding in Python: 30+ Programming Projects in Art, Games, and More"
"What I like best about this book is that the approach is to build a useful project, and use it to introduce programming concepts.  Starting in chapter 1, we build a simple chatbot, and use it to introduce important concepts such as variables, input, printing and commenting the code.  All the other introductory material I’ve come across starts with abstract programming concepts, without providing a framework of how to assemble the concepts into a program.  This book’s approach is much easier to grasp.Another important aspect are frequent sidebars to explain how to deal with the “overhead” of coding: how to create and save a new program file, how to interpret errors to debug the program, and that choosing good names for variables and functions is helpful in the long run.I can see this being a valuable textbook for computer classes as early as middle-school.  In addition to providing a shallow learning curve, each chapter ends with “Experiment and Extend” with some engaging programming project suggestions that could be homework or in-class assignments.  By the end of the book, we’ve progressed to writing interactive graphic games.I was inspired to create a turtle-graphic photo of a random walk, attached.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Creative Coding in Python: 30+ Programming Projects in Art, Games, and More"
"This is a great project-oriented way to learn the basics of Python. First thing you should note is that this is not a book for getting into the beginner's details of logic, theory, or fundamentals of coding. This book is a fun way to get beginners intrigued by coding by using fun and interesting projects that might pique their interest, because that's (arguably) more important at a younger age.This book gives a good taste of what Python is capable of doing without saying it outright. One issue I have with many other ""Intro"" level books is that they don't give applications for what you're learning, just the theory. This book does a good job giving context to that. Python has a ridiculous number of libraries, but the book gently introduces only the ones that are needed for a certain project, which include coding colorful geometric shapes, creating chatbots, and simple games.One thing to note is that, while this book is definitely for beginners, the language implies a certain level of reading comprehension, computer knowledge, self-starter-ness, and patience. So, don't toss this to your 8 year old and expect them to just run with it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Creative Coding in Python: 30+ Programming Projects in Art, Games, and More"
Learning to code is like learning a new language and this book is a great resource for learning Python.  It is a wonderfully written book that is easy to follow for any age.  It gets you starting to code right away as you learn relevant terms and how to apply them.  The author makes you aware of errors that can occur and how to address them.  The book inspires you to be creative as you are building different projects. It is very descriptive and goes in-depth enough to design your own game and create the art that goes along with it.  I love how the book takes you a step further and introduces how to connect the code to physical computing. As more school districts are adding computer programming into their curriculum Creative Coding in Python is a must-have for any classroom or for those of you who want to learn at home.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Creative Coding in Python: 30+ Programming Projects in Art, Games, and More"
"This book arrived just in time to make it into the Xmas stockings of the middle-schoolers on our list.It's a gentle introduction to programming (coding) with easy-to-follow declarative instructions accompanied by rich illustrations. Python is a suitable language for beginners in terms of syntax, popularity, and the availability of tools and samples. IDLE is a good starter environment to learn the ropes.The projects are simple and gratifying but leave room for creative experimentation. Starting from variables, operations, input/output the reader is introduced to more powerful concepts such as loops, conditions, and functions, eventually culminating in GUI's and animation. The companion website is useful for access to the underlying code though I think it's more educational to follow along and type the code.I look forward to future work from the author. Computing skills are gaining importance and this book is useful for anyone with the interest & motivation to learn more.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Creative Coding in Python: 30+ Programming Projects in Art, Games, and More"
"Looking at the TOC I am seeing 5 projects. Each project tries to teach different concepts and ideas of python. I was a little disappointed. I can't give it 5 stars for that. Also, I didn't find a big improvement over similar books that are already out there.Seems like another title for this could have been ""5 projects to teach python to kids again. "" I was hopeful that with 30 projects, there would be a lot more new stuff to take kids the next step with example code. How ever it seems like they count each topic in a project as a project in itself.

"Going to give this book 5 stars because the author does an excellent job of explaining Python in an informal way. Easily taking someone from a beginner level to a more advanced level. However I must add that in Chapter 1, it was nowhere near as easy to set up WingIDE as he explained. Now to be fair I was installing on Kali 2.0, but I downloaded the newest versions as well as the exact versions that were in the book. Still with no success. Yes I also tried the dependency command that was given as well as hours of Linux ""dependency"" posts. The program looks great so I still try to correct the dependency issue from time to time but initially I just gave up and continued with the book. Do not let this deter you.

"Coming from more of a network and security generalist's background I found this book to be very informative and direct to the point depending on what you are trying to accomplish at what stage of your attack.  I did find that you have to follow the precise instructions in chapter 1 - setting up your enviornment, for most of the code to work.  Python has changed quite a bit from version 2 and you have to pay attention while attempting to write and use the code. Don't skip chapter 1.What I found very useful was the socket programming and client/server/netcat examples found early on in the book.  The examples get more complex quckly after chapter 2 but Justin does a great job at notating the relevant sections and walking the reader through it carefully.

"Overall it is a pretty good book that covers a lot of different networking use cases.  I didn't give it five stars because it seemed to use vendor proprietary techniques versus using open standards.  For example the section on LLDP could have used SNMP tables to retrieve the data in a vendor agnostic way.  That alone would have shown an example of collecting table data (with rows and columns) from SNMP which is very useful to network administration.  I am not faulting the author's lab setups, which in themselves are very useful. I just don't agree with using a vendor specific method of gathering information when a non-vendor specific method is available.  I think that using non-vendor specific methods prevent having to re-write software when a new piece of equipment is added to the network.

"Have you ever wanted to learn about automating your network tasks through python? Then this is the book for you!When networks originally were built years ago, most of the devices were controlled by a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a human was expected to interact with the device. As networks became more complex and with the addition of virtual servers and switches having only a CLI interface, the networks have become cumbersome and almost unmanageable in today’s ever-changing environment.To counter the issues with the CLI interface, many networking components switched to what is called an Application Program Interface (API). An API allows granular control of your networking devices and is how many modern networks are now controlled.By using the many python libraries with the API interface of the networking components, logs can be built and ingested, metrics can be crunched, traffic can be monitored, with everything displayed on a nice central dashboard.These are some of the chapters I enjoyedChapter two of this book will teach you about the history of networks and how to set up python libraries on your network, along with creating a Virtual Lab!Chapter five teaches you more about Containers in your network, as a person that is familiar with containers from the VM side, I’m happy to see a chapter covering containers from the network perspective. Docker is also covered in this chapter.Chapter seven and 8 show you how to monitor your network traffic and build effective graphs using various libraries.I recommend using this book as a good reference guide when building and working on network projects.

I won't review every chapter, but I will list some highlights:Provides comprehensive coverage of Ansible for network automation.Addresses Docker networking which was a nice surprise. Containers are game changers, and the author does a great job of providing easy-to-understand explanations of containers and the associated networking.Two part chapter on network monitoring was absolute gold and something I plan on referring back to often in the åçfuture.Offers an insightful overview of building web APIs with the Flask library, making it a great starting point for those interested in exploring other Python web frameworks.Pytest is another one of those libraries that is essential to all who are using Python, and the fact that it is covered here is great.The versatility and widespread application of Python never cease to amaze me. As a continuous learner, I relish books that broaden my perspectives and showcase the limitless possibilities of the language. However, it can be challenging to find books that cater to a wide range of skill levels without being too simplistic or too complex and offer a coherent and systematic approach to learning.This fantastic book masterfully covers networking, containers, and Python.

"I enjoyed reading this book, a comprehensive guide to using Python for networking tasks. The book begins by reviewing the basics of the TCP/IP protocol suite and how it is used to facilitate communication on networks. It then goes on to cover low-level network device interactions, including how to use APIs and intent-driven networking to automate tasks and manage network devices.One of the standout features of this book is its focus on automation and the use of Python frameworks such as Ansible. The author provides detailed explanations and examples of how to use these tools to streamline network management and deployment. The inclusion of chapters on Docker containers and cloud networking (AWS and Azure) further expands the book's usefulness for modern network engineers.In addition to its technical content, the book also covers important topics such as network security and monitoring. The author presents practical approaches to securing networks using Python and discusses how to use the language for monitoring and analyzing network data using tools like the Elastic Stack.Overall, this book ""Mastering Python Networking 4E"" is a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about using Python for networking tasks. It provides a solid foundation in the TCP/IP protocol suite and covers a wide range of topics, from low-level device interactions to cloud networking and data analysis.

"I am a huge fan of this book. There's seemingly a free version of it online but it's worth paying for for the sake of longevity and also just to support the authors, who did a really great job.I'm a ""self-taught"" software engineer (in scare quotes because no one is really self taught), which means I have no formal training in data structures and algorithms. A lot of books and courses are math heavy, which makes sense in an academic context but isn't terribly practical. I don't need to do limits and integrals and things to understand and use tree algorithms, and this book doesn't ask me to.It's just a step by step, very practical introduction to basic data structures and algorithms. Can't recommend it highly enough for someone trying to get into these topics, especially if you've been put off by theory and math-heavy courses or books in the past.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python SECOND EDITION

"Mark O'Shea,s ""Boas and Pythons"" is 160 pages covering boas and pythons as well as other ""basal"" snakes, such as the blindsnakes, closer in evolutionary terms to the lizards from whom snakes are derived. The coffee-table sized volume examines these in their geographical categories (""The Americas"", Australasia and the Pacific Ocean Islands""), etc. The first part of the volume briefly describes snake evolution, anatomy, internal organ structure, diversity, the place in the suborder serpentes of the snakes described and their families. The author goes on to the subject of constriction and a discussion of snake size, myths about snakes and snakes as maneaters.This book is directed at the amateur with an interest in herpetology, perhaps, someone whose interest in snakes stems from having watched some of the Mr. O'Shea,s TV episodes. A minimum of technical terminology is used, descriptions being clear and understandable to non-professionals. THe book is richly illustrated with photographs of most of the species. After each species is discussed, i.e., the discovery history, scale numbers,  color variation and other information, the author provides a final paragraph briefly summarizing range, size, habitat, prey, egg-laying(number of eggs) or live birth and similar species. A four page index and two page bibliography for further reading appear at the end of the book. An interesting feature throughout the text are italicized paragraphs quoting the personal field experiences of O'Shea and other herpetologists with some of the snakes described. Maps are printed on the inside front and rear covers, sketching the world's continents with colored outlines of the ranges of the families covered in O'Shea's book. One drawback to this feature is that the author, in referring to islands and nations within a species range, does not provide a detailed-enough map to locate these, i.e., the Sunda Islands. Most readers would have to refer to a world atlas to determine where these are found.Nevertheless, O'Shea does a fine job informing and stimulating the interest of non-professionals in these families of snakes and in herpetology, in general.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Boas and Pythons of the World

"I've read all the books on Everest's 1996 season (and many others) so I've read about this expedition from all the POVs who've written their recollections, and seen all the documentaries.  So I had to see this too.Like many movies made of real events, it takes some real liberties with the truth, and to make it a better ""story"", consolidates and leaves out people and stories.  Given events where so many people died, though, misrepresenting events to make a better story is well, disrespectful. In addition, Krakauer is made more central to the action -- the Sherpa leaders are shown appealing to him on various things, and he's mentioned as being involved in the rescues, when in fact, Krakauer was only a client, not involved in decision making, Sherpa leading, or rescuing. (A really embarrassing scene is when a Sherpa begs Krakauer to stop so they can rest).  Not that Krakauer didn't perform well on the mountain, being one of the first to summit, but no way would he have a Sherpa begging him to stop so they could rest.Boukreev who was Fischer's lead guide, is shown in a fairly unflattering light.  There's of course controversy on this. If you read the survivors accounts, certain of Boukreev's clients said they didn't want to be alone on the mountain with him, because they felt he wasn't responsive to their needs. Of course, Boukreev had a different perception of a guides duties.  But when he was heading down the mountain he blew past clients that could have used his help, and as for his activities during client's acclimatization, Fischer was reported to have bitterly complained to his business manager that Boukreev was not attending to clients. So while the movie over-dramatizes that conflict, there really was some basis for it.  And it also reportedly left Fischer overly stressed and overworked, which perhaps left him underacclimatized and contributed to the edema that killed him.  On the other hand, even if too little too late, after the clients failed to return, Boukreev went out and saved many lives.  Still, I think the script was overly hard on him.As far as accuracy on climbing details, there were some irritations - climbers not wearing goggles at times (when even a few minutes exposure could result in snow blindness) or gloves.  Of course an actor covered in mask and goggles can be hard to discern one from the other.  And don't think you'll see the Himalaya here,  this was filmed in the alps. The long acclimatization climbs are more or less skipped over.OTOH, things like the logjam on the Step, the suddenness of the storm, the effects of running out of oxygen on climbers, are done well.  It's only once the storm hits that things go far off accuracy again, with the Krakauer being involved in the rescues and coordination more than he was.So basically, if you watch this the first time, you might really find objectionable that it deviates in some respects from actual occurrences. and draws some characters and events with a too broad and thus somewhat inaccurate brush..  But it actually isn't too bad a movie, when you realize that all movies of true events deviate somewhat from the truth to tell a story. And while this has some deviations from reality that seem excessive at first, actually it really isn't too far off the mark, or too bad a movie.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Into Thin Air: Death On Everest

However the Mt. Everest movies/documentaries actually just get me mad! Only watched a few and I think the same thing every time! Life is so very precious why on earth would you risk your life and devastate your family for the sake of a stupid mountain? Is it to brag? be closer to God? Whatever the reason is isn't worth risking life!  I cannot feel sorry for those that die on Everest, they deliberately put themselves into a life threatening situation.

TV-ish. Its not horrible but its not that great either. It reminds me of the Airport movies if that makes sense. They took a disaster, in this case a real one, and instead of just telling the story, they tried to inject more drama in to it.

"I would strongly suggest reading the book before seeing this movie.  The technical details of climbing Everest are many.  A movie cannot cover how this tragedy was caused by a series of circumstances, each contributing to the final outcome.  There was a lot of fallout in the years after this horrible event.  Perhaps the movie would have been better using a series of flashbacks from the fallout.

Also, watch the Hollywood version of ""Everest""...fantastic movie!

"I've bought a lot of technical books over the years, maybe 100 or more.  Recently picked up fluent python and several django and python programming books.  This is definitely one of the better books on python and django.  In fact this book covers so much ground and touches on so many different related topics and subjects, I felt like it was answering general questions about python that I've had floating around in the back of my mind for at least a year.  Overall, I would put this book in my top 5 (ever) programming books list, up there with Wrox Beginning Linux Programming 4th edition and Fluent Python. This book casually takes you from zero to hero in one night. It even manages to cover installing Jenkins for CI, and introduces you to fabric for automating deployments, I could go on.Percival has an amazing ability to demystify and penetrate even dense topics such as introducing JavaScript to the non web programmer, which I am not.  My favorite part about the book is how aware the author is of the reader's shock at the very beginning of just how many tests the pure TDD paradigm espouses.  Every time doubts start creeping up in the back of your mind, and you think to yourself  ""There's just no way I am going to write this many tests or develop using this methodology!"", Percival sidebars you with brilliant analysis and commentary, and lauds you to have the patience to plow forward and trust the process.  Very rarely do technical authors have this kind of insight into what their target audience is thinking, and even fewer are able to incorporate antidotes to the ""resistance"" that undoubtedly many readers will experience while reading through the first few chapters, in their initial foray into what TDD is all about and most importantly, THE WHY of TDD.  Bravo Percival!Well worth the price, and up to date being released August 2017.  Very few up to date books about django anymore, which is sad for those like me that are very late to the party (apparently), though i did manage to find one or two that cover 1.11.Buy this book, and learn TDD, it will solve problems you've experienced while writing code that you didn't know could be solved.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Test-Driven Development with Python: Obey the Testing Goat: Using Django, Selenium, and JavaScript"

"I had great hopes for this book in attracting my 11 year old son to coding through games. I'm glad it tries to lead him through the gory details of installing python and pygame. What's disappointing is not so much the book, which is well presented and engaging, but the difficulties we encountered just getting up and running. It turns out that, on a mac, you can't necessarily count on pygame being compatible with the latest version of python, but there's no help for this. A couple of days trial and error and I discovered that pygame will only work on python 3.7.x, it's not truly ready for 3.8.  The pygame site page for mac users is woefully out of date, inadequate, impossible for any but a true coder to follow.That hurdle conquered, we have an installed version! But, come to find out that the next most basic steps... don't work. For yet another (probably mac-based) reason, ""there is a problem"" with pygame and getting the window to have focus. I guess we'll struggle through this too. Gosh it's enough to make me try to contribute to this project.

"Code This Game is an excellent book that teaches Python programming by guiding the reader through making a tower-defense game from scratch. This is a book that doesn't shy away from programming detail, but manages to remain fun and engaging. If you have a student or child who wants to move beyond MIT's Scratch programming tool and do ""real"" programming, this is a great book.The book features a tower defense game called Attack of the Pizza Vampires, and anyone who's ever played the popular Plants vs. Zombie games will recognize its influence here. The graphics are provided from a free website download, but the reader copies the code from the book, accompanied by explanations of the relevant programming concepts.Don't let the 300+ page count intimidate you: The pages are short and colorful, and the chapters are well-paced and let you see the progress you've made as you go from absolutely nothing to a full game. The book covers Pygame, a free software library for Python that has been used in some commercial video games, but is still simple enough to be approachable by young adults. The book itself includes a small stand to prop the pages up, making it easy to read as the reader enters the Python code into their computer.From my experience teaching with after school coding clubs, I agree with the stated 10 to 14 age range. This book would be suitable for motivated 9 or maybe even 8 year olds and for older teenagers if they look past the colorful cartoony presentation. The code and teaching itself is solid. Your student or child might be able to read this book on their own, but I think a parent or teacher (even one without programming experience) could be a great help to follow along with. I also think this book could be useful for an after school coding club or intro to programming class: the game project is split up in such a way that it makes for a good resource to work through over multiple sessions.I like how the book doesn't mind going into technical topics, but at the same a hard understanding of these terms isn't necessary to create the Attack of the Pizza Vampires game and get a sense of accomplishment. The introductory chapter has lots of useful tips for setting up your computer (whether Windows, macOS , or another operating system) to get Python installed and running. These ""environment setup"" steps are often a large stumbling block in getting a single student or entire class started on programming games, so the presence of this information shows good foresight on behalf of the authors.Python is excellent programming language for beginners. If you're looking for a resource that teaches actual programming skills while still be approachable, I recommend Code This Game.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Code This Game!: Make Your Game Using Python, Then Break Your Game to Create a New One!"
"One of the most difficult things about teaching kids to code is finding the perfect balance between making the material educational and making it fun and appealing to kids. That’s what’s so special about Bite-Size Python, by April Speight.This book is written to teach kids the basics of coding. It does not require any prior knowledge. A child who picks up this book will be walked through everything they need: from installing Python and related tools, to basic programming concepts, to some engaging activities to exercise what they’ve learned. No adult help or supervision should be required. The lessons are just the right level of detail to stay brief yet informative. The book is perfect for students in the 9-12 year age range.The practice exercises are very high-quality. They involve subjects that should be relevant and engaging for a wide variety of young learners. They’re put into a relatable context: you want to play Mad Libs with your friends; Mariah is trying to randomly pick a green marble out of the bag; kids need to be split randomly into two teams so they can play kickball. These contexts can help kids see the sorts of problems that coding can help them solve, which is important. Not every kid will love coding at first, but every kid will see reasons to use coding to solve these problems. Each lesson simply and clearly demonstrates why the software constructs – arrays, loops, functions, etc. – exist and how they help you achieve your goals.Another important feature of this book is the inclusivity it shows. The internal artwork features kids of different races, genders, and abilities.  The book does not talk down to kids or exaggerate how cool and fun coding can be. It’s a straightforward example of why and how you can learn to code.The author, April Speight, is a perfect source of information for this book. She didn’t start out as a software engineer, but found a love for it after college and transitioned into a role as a software evangelist, speaker and teacher. Her path into software is reflected in this book as a plain-spoken approach that teaches what you need to know without being boring.  She doesn’t shove coding at the reader, yet shares a love of what coding can help you accomplish.  You can learn more about the author at vogueandcode.com.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bite-Size Python: An Introduction to Python Programming
"The book is the first coding publication I LOVE. Being a visual learner, I learn best when the size of the text is large and the critical information is in color. It has been difficult to interpret other publications based on printing black and white text while using single space lines that strain my eyesight and the absence of practice questions at the end of each lesson. This book is PERFECT for all ages. The author keeps it short and straightforward while providing meaningful exercises and review questions according to Bloom's Taxonomy. NEVER have I made a serious commitment to learning Python until now. I purchased many Python books thinking they would motivate me only to toss them on my bookshelf after chapter two. It cannot get any simpler learning Python. The lessons are short and focus on the reader demonstrating (hands-on) the task in return. I enjoy using this publication to learn Python. I have purchased and distributed several copies to a CTE Business  Teacher at a middle school, used it as a reference for my engineering academy enrichment camp this past summer, and a female student to encourage her to embrace learning how to code. My goal is to persuade the principal to purchase copies (fifteen minimum) for the learning (media) center while hiring a Computer Science Teacher at my high school.As a CTE Technology Education Teacher seeking to encourage my Engineer students to learn how to code and program, I endorse this publication and challenge the author to publish a sequel that will activate critical thinking skills when using the Python language with a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino kit.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bite-Size Python: An Introduction to Python Programming

Great book for learning python and easy to follow. A must read!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bite-Size Python: An Introduction to Python Programming
"I had an extremely difficult time with programming in college. At that time, only COBAL and FORTRAN existed. JAVA, PYTHON and other languages were not invented yet. I have been going through all the examples in ""Bite-Sized Python"" and I am of the opinion that this is one of the easiest and best way to learn python for advanced youngsters or oldsters like myself.  Every chapter is filled with simple and direct examples that actually work if you type them precisely as you set them in print. Overall, this is an excellent, no nonsense kind of book that gets you to learn without having any fill material to shift your attention elsewhere. It is good that many functions have several examples to explain the function and answer.A minor problem for me was that several functions somehow did not work using Python 3.8 even with all the necessary libraries installed. Tried a different computer and the problem was solved. Otherwise, excellent book that covers most of the major functions you should know without the added fluff. Highly recommended for students and elders like myself. Truly excellent writing and layout and to the point.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bite-Size Python: An Introduction to Python Programming
"I’m already confident with Python but have been using this to introduce it to my kids. The eldest has had plenty of time with Scratch so was already familiar with ideas such as variables and co-ordinates, and it seemed like a good way to step up into ‘grown-up’ Python ideas.It is very much pitched at the very start of programming concepts such as loops and functions, firmly beginner’s stuff, and the presentation is pitched at what I feel is a slightly vague level. The font and particularly the font size is especially junior, making secondary school kids think of it as childish, yet the text is decidedly picture-free and to a large extent joke-free, in danger of making primary school kids think that it is dull. Luckily my daughter was keen on the idea of learning Python in 2021 and didn’t take any persuading- if I was trying to persuade a recalcitrant learner, I’m not sure this book would look fun enough.The structure of it is very sound though. After the unavoidable “how to install Python” chapter and an introduction to IDLE (including fairly basic computing instructions such as how to save a file), it’s a methodical series of concept introductions- variables, conditionals, lists, loops, functions, dictionaries, modules and finally some next steps, which briefly introduces matplotlib and teases the first idea of graphics display while the rest of the book is entirely based on plain text output.Each chapter builds up to a simple program that feels real-world relevant (sometimes a little tenuously). Towards the start of the book there are occasional spot quizzes (labelled Checkpoints) to check the reader’s understanding, but as the book progresses these get fewer and are gradually replaced with more ambitious multi-part projects, like generating a sign-up form for the school musical.Some of the writing is a little on the prosaic side, and does feel like it could still be understandable whilst being a bit more succinct- but impatient readers (such as my kids) also found that they could pick up most of the concepts involved if they lazily skipped over the main body of text and just looked at the highlighted sections and the code examples! So I suppose that’s a positive result showing the balanced presentation of the book.For a kids book there are a handful of Americanisms in the book to be aware of, the most frequent being variable names like “favorite_color” instead of “favourite_colour”, which is pretty common and inevitable in programming tutorials but I still like to stick with teaching “favourite_colour” to stop it from creeping into the rest of their spelling. The example address given in the penultimate chapter is American, for example.If you’ve already had any level of practice with a different programming language and you want to make the transition into Python, this book will be below you, as it spends much of the time teaching ideas and concepts that aren’t even language-specific. The book is based on “the latest” version of Python (always an unwise statement to put in a printed book!), and shows Python 3.7, but the commands are so simple and fundamental to Python that they are definitely compatible with Python 3.9, and as far as I’ve seen, I reckon it would all work with Python 2 as well.The book starts deceptively slowly, but over the course of a little over 200 pages, it does end up encompassing really quite a lot of ideas and concepts which, if genuinely new to programming, could all be a bit mind-blowing. Depending on the existing level of experience, it might be better to tackle it all in bite-sized lesson chunks. My daughter in particular was lapping this book up and kept wanting to do more, which is certainly positive feedback about the book and the learning experience, but with hindsight, smaller chunks and more reinforcement of the previous lessons would probably have been wiser.This is a nicely laid out and methodical book and it’s already proven very useful with my kids. However a little bit more clarity, better presentation and just a tiny little bit more of a fun factor is what are missing, in my opinion, and leave me just short of giving it five stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bite-Size Python: An Introduction to Python Programming
"This is aimed at kids - in look and the level it's pitched at. It's not going to motivate someone to learn to programme, but it's a great guide for children who are keen to learn and need some help. If they've used scratch (many kids do learn this in school) then this is the next step.I think a child as young as 10 or 11 could use this, but I think when you get to age 13 or 14, this would not really be deemed suitable (as tested by my own 10 and 13 year olds!) as it feels to childish.It starts simple and I think, even though tech moves on, this would still give many of the basic concepts needed to still be useful for a few years.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bite-Size Python: An Introduction to Python Programming

The book covers a lot of important ground and the material is presented well. I think practitioners, whether in academia or industry, will especially appreciate the chapter on common pitfalls, which highlights several common problems we often run into in applied work. Parts I and II of the  book (Thinking/Speaking like a Data Head) will help build skills that are critical to applied data science (e.g., asking the right questions and thinking  about variation).

The beginning of the chapters provides an overview of the content followed by short exercises that are actually very stimulating. I was drawn into the book after finishing chapter 2 exercises. There are also solutions, and the solutions are mind-blowing in the sense that the author doesn’t just give you the right answer, he explains the way to approach the questions and the logic behind answering sequencing questions using programming.

Good refresher anyway; I'll check out the ""advanced"" sequel book now I guess.If you are in the bio / bio-tech or related fields, and maybe know just a little coding but want to learn more and improve, and use a language that is very much used in science these days - this book is a worthy investment. It starts out detailing the fundamental syntax and structure of Python, using real world hypothetical examples that will be familiar to bio / chem / tech people, such as DNA sequence manipulations. It progresses from very simple code to progressively more advanced scripts, and in each case explaining well as it goes on. Chapters end with a concise review, examples and some practice problems - the best way to learn coding (or anything else).Highly recommend this.Cheers.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Biologists: A complete programming course for beginners
"Great, great book. I think this is the perfect book for any biologist to who wants to start learning to code with Python.

I didn't know a command-line from a hole in the ground when I first opened up this book, and mere days later I was impressing my colleagues with my own DNA analysis programs. I actually have this book to thank for easing me into programming which is now something I do everyday as part of my profession.This book is definitely unique for biologists in that it has you learning some aspects of python that are useful for biological applications right away- techniques which are normally several chapters down the road in general programming books. That being said, if you want to get serious about coding, because this book doesn't go over all areas of python, you will be well-served by also getting a second general python programming introduction book that goes over stuff this book does not cover.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Biologists: A complete programming course for beginners

This one gives you practical applications for every programming tool you learn. With its breezy style and short chapters, it just zips right along, painlessly filling your brain with maximum Python in the minimum possible time.

"Just completed the first ""real"" chapter (Chapter 2) and I've found multiple errors in the Chapter 2 exercise solutions, and shortcomings in the explanations prior to performing the exercises. The download link for exercise files includes updated versions which have corrected some of these number syntax errors from the book, but not all errors. Example: author says to be careful of remembering ""character 1 is position 0"" in the text, but then goes on to make the exact same mistake in the solutions and carrying the same principle to higher position numbers in the sequence. Further issues include stating ""from __future__ import division"" is only necessary for those running Python 2, but it's also necessary for those running Python 3 without use of floating numbers, and the float() command was not introduced, meaning ""from __future__ import division"" would be necessary to run your code to calculate percentages.Edited: Dropped another star. The way the information is presented would be great and could be deserving of 5 stars, except being guided into multiple pitfalls BEFORE showing you how to do things properly (yes, you're often shown the wrong way first, second, third, and fourth...) and the multiple errors in the very first set of exercises is pretty disappointing. The correct way needs to absolutely be shown first in order for the reader to understand why programming pitfalls exist. Trapping the reader into committing errors multiple times over in different ways before showing the proper syntax is unnecessarily confusing. This book really, really needs an editor. Way too many unintentional typos (not referring to the UK English used, but actual typos) and errors that are easy to gloss over if you're not paying really close attention. No surprise biologists with no programming experience reviewing the book think it should be 5 stars--as superficially, it's great--but once you get into the meat of it and understand what's going on you'll see a lot of problems.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Biologists: A complete programming course for beginners

I am always looking for high quality and practical educational material.  Dr. Mark Fenner's ""Machine learning with Python for Everyone"" is high quality, practical, and educational.The author's preface describes the intended audience.  ""I've written 'Machine Learning with Python for Everyone' for the absolute beginner to machine learning.  Even more so, you may well have little college-level mathematics in your toolbox and I'm not going to try to change that.  While many machine learning books are very heavy on mathematical concepts and equations, I've done my best to minimize the amount of mathematical luggage you'll have to carry.  I do expect, given the book's title, that you'll have some basis proficiency in Python.  If you can read Python, you'll be able to get a lot more out of our discussions.  While many books on machine learning rely on mathematics, I'm relying on stories, pictures, and Python code to communicate with you.""Please read the Table of Contents and introductory material, accessible though the 'Look Inside' feature on the book's Amazon page.Throughout the book, the material is clearly presented and requires no previous introduction to machine learning.  That said, while there are no mathematical proofs, and there is some mathematical notation, the reader will need to be comfortable with charts, graphs, and mathematical concepts and terminology.Dr. Fenner covers machine learning from the perspective of developing predictive machine learning models.  He discusses many techniques for developing classification and regression models using well chosen examples and explanations.  His writing style is informal and enjoyable.While this is not a workbook with many listings of ready-to-run machine learning projects, it does include many short examples, written in well-formed Python 3, illustrating concepts and techniques.I highly recommend this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with Python for Everyone (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)
"The title led me to believe that it would be a complete tutorial including how to set up an environment to use the examples in the book. Unless I'm missing something the book depends on the reader being familiar with juypter and has the time and energy to enter a fairly large python module by hand from the appendix. The text and examples seem interesting but I didn't have the time to enter the required python module. And I'd prefer running the examples instead of taking the author's word that they work as described. I was able to return the book but I'm had high hopes that ""Everyone"" included me.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with Python for Everyone (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)
Mark is a wonderful writer and he is able to simplify a topic as complex as machine learning and turn it into an easy to understand presentation. This is easily the best survey of machine learning I have seen. Having well thought out exercises and examples that anyone can run on their home computer makes this book even more valuable. Highly recommended.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with Python for Everyone (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)
"I really appreciated Mark's approach to the ever present stack/tool chain issue that stands as a stumbling block to people getting started.  The information is relevant, up to date and approaches many of the same data science/ML hello world type scenarios with a very deep functional perspective.  To go further, I had a question about one of the external libraries... reached out to Mark, and was immediately provided a response.  I highly recommend this text.Sean O'Brien",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with Python for Everyone (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)

"I have been developing in Django for a while, but felt it was time to dive into React and came across this book as it appeared to be a great fit. I really want to like this book because I feel it combines three powerful areas (Django, React, AWS), all which are relevant in building modern solutions today. While I still recommend this book, there are a couple of frustrations I came across.First, I feel the Django concepts covered in this book are a little bit older and more manual approaches, which isn't necessarily a bad thing for everyone to at least learn. There are newer Class-based views help keep things much friendlier and easier to understand, along with very well supported and used plugins that handle a lot of the heavy lifting and support for you (django-allauth, etc.). If anyone is curious about these, I would highly recommend William S Vincent's ""Django for APIs"" in addition to this book (also his ""Django for Beginners"" if you are new). This author doesn't spend much time talking through how things work, or why he is structuring the code the way he does.The second concern I have with this book is the number of areas where code is incorrect or missing from the examples in the book, and sometimes the screenshots are a couple of steps ahead where they are shown in the book. It looks like they didn't have an editor look over everything and make sure things line up. If you are trying to learn something new, you have to piece things together to get some of the examples to work at times (which honestly isn't a terrible way to learn something new).Overall, if you don't mind keeping an open mind and working around issues and typos, it is still a great concept book that can get you started!",3.0 out of 5 stars,Full Stack Django and React: Hands-on full-stack web development with Python and React
"How are there two reviewers on a book with so many mistakes? And even their bios are poorly written.The reason you buy a book is to have it all in one place and to follow a project through. All while having a place to take notes. My margins were filling up with notes about mistakes and misworded explanations.The typos are the canary in the coal mine warning us of code omissions, inaccurate code, incorrect formatting, misleading explanations. Which kinda like, whatever. The bigger problem is the things I don’t notice that are wrong. Misinformation. But I’m so frustrated I paid money for something so, so, so poorly done. I’m recycling the book and cutting my losses.Just think how bad a book would have to be to make someone type out an Amazon review.In addition to the typos galore (I mean impressive amount), there’s the issue of just the order of presentation. Starts to talk about JWTs then switches over to Organizing a Project. Why do it that way?The author isn’t particularly responsive on GH. And you have to go to GH to see other people offering corrections for author’s mistakes.I will think long and hard before buying another Packt product.

"This book was very helpful especially in the backend development.The front end development was little confusing. CSS was mentioned but there was no CSS file everything was hard coded. For best practice it's important to separate your css from your js or Jsx files in your file structure.I won't advise using S3 for this kind of application, S3 bucket is suitable for deploying a static application. This application is dynamic. I don't know why we deployed react separate from Django, doing that made the process more tedious.I will use webpack and babel while I am developing and at the very end before deployment. Task managers and module bundlers help you monitor your static files as you go. You will have the minified version before deployment.There was no interaction with the Django admin, its good place to visualize models before checking on the browser.Using database was not clearly explained on AWS, it's important to understand the different types of data bases on AWS, since we are using Postgres, explaining RDS will help.Overall the book was helpful in understanding basic development process.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Full Stack Django and React: Hands-on full-stack web development with Python and React
"The first thing I noticed about this book was its size. At 432 pages it seems to be about the right size. Many programming books go overboard with the length, and this one gets it right. There's  about 100 pages devoted to Django development, which is enough to help set up the project and get the API endpoints. Then there's a chapter on unit testing the Python code, which I appreciated. There are around 200 pages devoted to the react app, and the rest to deploying it, everything from installing git to dockerizing the app and deploying it to AWS.I currently work in React (but not Django), however I've helped teach a course in Django. From my estimation this book has a good format for understanding Django, or at least for creating the backend. It assumes knowledge of Python and walks through commands to implement the app, without going in too much depth. This might be a challenge to some who like to know exactly how every line functions, but this is something you need to get used to with frameworks: there are often things to set up codewise that will not make sense until you have seen it in multiple contexts. This book does a good job of introducing each part with a big picture idea (""now we are going to use the api to delete the post"" etc.) before diving into the code.In explaining React, the book does a good job of showing how to set up everything from scratch. This is using a more basic idea of react than I use currently at my own job, but it's still React. What I mean is, I don't see a lot of use of hooks being used, such as useState, useEffect, useMemo, useContext, useCallback, etc. which are found in many production apps these days. Also I don't see typescript being used, which is a standard. It uses a library called Axios to make API calls (which I learned on, but I currently use useQuery for this). I will say this book teaches what it does teach in a straightforward manner which may be more helpful for a beginning student of React, and hooks and typescript definitely could make it more confusing.I cannot speak much about the AWS section. I haven't deployed to AWS myself before, however I look forward to doing so as I walk further through the book.The strength of this book lies in the marketability of React and Django, and it offers something that isn't seen in many places elsewhere. Its overall design delivers on its promise of helping someone achieve the basics of a single page application with api backend.Overall, great layout, strong content and screenshots. I would say 4.5/5, but Amazon will only accept whole numbers!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Full Stack Django and React: Hands-on full-stack web development with Python and React
"The subject matter of this book seemed to be perfect, as it covers building an API in Django, building a front-end for the API with React, and how to host it in AWS. At least...I suspect it does, but I couldn't make it through the ""building an API"" portion.In terms of being a ""by example"" book, this is hands down THE WORST I've ever used. Every single time you add a feature, there will be broken code, typos, stuff missing. Your code will not run, you will have to troubleshoot what is wrong. Every. Time. The errata on the GitHub page is helpful, but the quantity of mistakes in the book is overwhelming and the errata doesn't come close to capturing them all.I tried to press through it all, with the optimism that maybe I'm learning more by having to troubleshoot everything, but it really becomes a slog that feels like a colossal waste of time. The text describing what the code is doing is often vague and non-explanatory, so just reading the book without attempting to follow along isn't very useful either.Honestly, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this book. It's not worth your time or money until somebody goes through and corrects the incredible amount of mistakes.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Full Stack Django and React: Hands-on full-stack web development with Python and React
"As a full stack developer, using both Django and react, this book has the 400 pages that I needed to refresh some forgotten concepts. This allows me to write my viewsets using a more understanding approach, structure my Django project more professionally, and that React explanation was everything.Great job Kolawole!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Full Stack Django and React: Hands-on full-stack web development with Python and React
"The book contains several typos and errors that lead to 'code not working'. By the end of chapter 2, I got so much tired of debugging the author's codes that I had to quit it. I was spending 10x time on debugging author's codes rather learning something new. If I have to extensively read Django's official guide to know what errors author has made, then why not I just read the official guide and skip the book.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Full Stack Django and React: Hands-on full-stack web development with Python and React

"I have currently only read just over 100+ pages in this book and it has been the most useful 100 pages of information that I have come across. This is saying a lot as someone who is not only a Data Analyst for a Fortune 500 company. Also, I am someone who has completely immersed myself in so many tutorials, books, webinars, classes, articles, etc. in search of the right material to really understand data analytics. George Mount had me sold on this book when hearing him speak on Excel, R, and Python in a way that just makes so much more sense than the common narrative of bashing Excel and putting R and Python in competition with each other. He talks with nuance about how they each have their roles. He understands the real-to-life uses of each of these tools that can help one to see that he knows exactly what he's talking about. This book is not just another book in a vast space of so MANY resources out there (believe me, I know first hand). This book has easily risen to the top of any content that I have been in front of up to this point and I will owe George the greatest thanks when my career really takes off further. I gladly would have paid George my college tuition for this one book instead.Lastly, if you are in your career as a data analyst, looking to how you can start a career in data analytics, a student at a university. Just save yourself so much heartache and pain. Pick up this book and know that it can have a major ROI as it has done for me.Thank you, George",5.0 out of 5 stars,Advancing into Analytics: From Excel to Python and R
"If you are an analyst working in a competitive organization, looking for ways to differentiate yourself and add value, then it's important to continue to explore and expand your skillset. This book serves this need generously and is quite unique as the author walks the reader through a multi-tool journey from Excel to R to Python, weaving in statistical concepts and a generous heap of syntax along the way. Personally, I am implementing Python in some of my work and this book serves as a helpful ongoing resource. A sequel would be great, perhaps expanding on more use cases and expanded implementation in Python. An exploration of BI tools may be a good fit also, and use case for the integration of Python and BI would be an implementation I would personally benefit from. It is a permanent resident in my career book collection in the meantime.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Advancing into Analytics: From Excel to Python and R
"Mr. Mount obviously knows his subject matter, but what impressed me most was his ability to convey complex concepts in an accessible way. The book is full of graphs, charts, examples, ""tips"" and ""warnings"" that bring light to the topics. The tone is personal, yet to the point. Mr. Mount's objective is not to impress readers with his own considerable knowledge, but to gently guide them to develop their own skill set. After reading the book, I felt as if I'd just had a pleasant conversation with a very good, and very intelligent, friend. Well worth the money.

"I was so excited to get Advancing into Analytics! As someone that feels fairly high level in Excel, I wanted analytical skills to take me to the next level. Analytical skills are sought after for lots of jobs out there (it seems like more and more so these days), but I just wanted to broaden my current skill set to get a leg up and make myself even more competitive in the job market. This book delivers and then some!George Mount (the author) begins the book in Excel, which was a nice comfortable way to ease into the Analytics world. The book gives you great access to a repository that allows you to follow along in the book in real time with what is happening in the exercises. You start off learning about exploratory data analysis.The second to fourth chapters delve into foundations of probability. Let me tell you I was worried about these chapters as I was never that strong in math in school, but everything was explained in such simple terms that I was easily able to grasp the concepts. Gradually as the concepts became harder I felt like everything had been scaffolded in a way that made everything easy to understand.In part 2 of the book we’re introduced to R, a computer programming language to use for statistical computing. I was definitely a little intimidated but the transition to R was made easy by what I had learned in the Excel section. Through the next chapters I learned about data manipulation and visualization in R.The last portion of the book delves into Python in a similar way that the section on R does, but just in Python. So pick your poison or learn both!One last note- the exercises after every chapter were super helpful to master the concepts in a practical way. It really helped illustrate the concepts. I also have to note that I was stoked not to have to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars on some course- this did the trick for WAY LESS $!

"I liked the idea that the book tried to sell: Advancing into Analytics.From Excel to R and Python.From a beginner to a budding analyst.I bought into the idea because I too learned that way: from (1) easy Excel to advanced Excel like DAX, M, Power Query, and VBA, and then to (2) Power BI, which led me down the path to (3) R and SQL, and then (4) eventually into the coils of Python. And as someone still on the journey, I dare argue that most of the data analytics’ core concepts and procedures, including data mining, can be learned with Excel. (Good example is “Learn Data Mining Through Excel” by Hong Zhou or ""Business Analytics"" by James R. Evans.) Of course, at some point, you need more powerful and specialized tools for specific needs.Alas, I cannot defend this book because it poses as a book for someone who has zero base, but in fact is a review note for those who’ve already seen the entirety once or twice. And even as a review note, it’s mundane at best. The book covers a whooping range of topics with such shallowness that at one point the author felt justified in introducing half of introductory inferential statistics (a material that deserves an entire semester’s worth of learning or a textbook of hundreds of pages) in mere 18 pages, without fully explaining each of the concepts introduced.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Advancing into Analytics: From Excel to Python and R

Upon completion, I immediately began considering ways to apply my new knowledge effectively to other real-world scenarios.  This is a book that an aspiring data analyst can work through at their own pace and finish confident that they are prepared to apply its principles in Excel, R, and Python.

"I bought this book for my 13 year old nephew and he seems to enjoying it so far. Using the instructions provided in the book, he was able to independently download Python, install it on his laptop and was able to start coding using the examples and step by step instructions provided in the book. I wanted to give him this book before introducing him to something more voluminous like ""Python for kids"" by Jason R. Briggs (at just about 90 pages with lots of pictures and illustrations, this book is on the lighter side. It is also somewhat inexpensive - though given the content it seems to be priced right.). It also does not get into Object oriented programming. It does cover Lists and Dictionaries and also introduces Turtle graphics. It also cover loops (for and while loops), control flow (if then else) and introduces functions. The books ends with two larger projects, which are essentially games. The strength of this book is Visual step by step instructions and a colorful presentation which is more likely to keep young readers interested and engaged. I would like to give it four and half stars but the reason I am not giving it five stars is because I feel that there was no way to tell what age group it targets and what level of depth it goes into without actually buying the book and reading it or laying your hands on it somewhere else. There is almost no introduction or summary at the back of the contents covered or level targeted. Also, while this is a great first book, your kid must not stop here - this is just a great first book and unless one continues to build on by reading more advanced stuff, it may not amount to much.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Coding for Beginners: Using Python [Hardcover] [Jan 01, 2017] Louie Stowell"
"Enjoying this book - a straight-forward and easy to follow introduction to Python.I would just like to leave to notes:[1] In the 'snowflake drawing' exercise, don't save your program as 'turtle' as Python will then try importing your own program in place of the 'turtle' module.[2] In this same exercise, the snowflake will not draw properly if you follow the instructions (!). The code that tells your turtle to go backward(120) should be in the next piece of code so you should write:def snowflakeArm():  for x in range(0,4):  forward(30)  vshape()def snowflake():  for x in range(0,6):  snowflakeArm()  backward(120)  right(60)snowflake()Doing this worked for me. This makes more sense, as the turtle has to draw the full snowflakeArm before going back to its start point. The way the book has it, the turtle draws a sort of hexagon instead. Working this out helped me better understand the program.Hope this helps.Also: In the Bat/Ball game, the box asking if you want to play again won't pop up. To fix this I used two lines of code I found in another book {Coding for Beginners, by Mike McGrath}The lines of code go between the first and second lines at the start of your program, so you get this:import tkinterfrom tkinter import*import tkinter.messagebox as boximport timeDoing this made the replay button pop up.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Coding for Beginners: Using Python [Hardcover] [Jan 01, 2017] Louie Stowell"

"This is an excellent book for beginners as it covers what to expect in Windows, Mac and how to download the Python software.

This would have been useful to people new to programming and those with a little knowledge of programming but moving on to Python. I hope a section on the topic of program constructs is included to a revised edition to make the book very valuable to children and adults entering university or those in colleges learning programming for the first time. Another useful coverage is how to save your file and that ‘a variable is like a labelled box that stores information’, this is an area that is very confusing to a beginner programmer as they cannot visualise what a variable is so you have to bring it down to that level.

"This book, while it is what you would expect from non-OO python programming.  Relies heavily on Linux and a Pre-Built module for templates etc.  These days with how things are shaping up you would expect to see these types of books written as OS agnostic or have separate chapters to cover environment setup.

"This book really helped my get reacquainted with Python. The book uses the argparse module to teach you how to write professional level command line programs.

"I'm a new programmer who learned how to program in Anaconda, so using programs from the command line is a particular weak spot of mine that I wanted to correct.This book intentionally asks the reader to avoid using notebooks IDEs like Jupyter and instead instructs the reader in downloading an editor.As other reviewers noted, using Windows was a bit of challenge. Even using WSL didn't solve some issues since it scrambled some of the output. I ended up just switching to my linux machine to alleviate this.This books focuses on how to develop a program using the argparse module (among others) and running tests along the way with each program. The author provides explanation behind pylint, flake8, and other testing programs for python and teaches the reader how to decipher their output. The book also instructs you in how to write programs to python community standards. For me, this is invaluable as my python instruction has not taught this.Other reviewers are correct in that the author does not explicitly teach the different functions of the argparse module. However, this is not a beginner's book. You need some familiarity with how to read a function's parameters in order to pick up on what's going on.In one exercise for instance, the author has you copy a pre-made program template and  instructs you to delete all the arguments defined in a function except one, according to the program's needs. You are then supposed to test the output until yours matches the one he provides. While obviously not ideal for a beginner, I had enough experience to figure it out on my own how to change the program and adjust parameters accordingly and see how those changes were reflected when I ran the program in the command line.For me, it was a process of learning by discovery. When the output didn't match his, I could read the parameters again and intuit what needed to be changed.  I feel encouraged to read python's documentation and experiment on my own since I have a handle on what the argparse module can do.While I haven't finished the book, I'm enjoying it a lot. It provides short, fun programs as side projects and teaches me some things I've been wanting to learn. I believe the os and sys modules are covered later on, but I haven't reached that part yet.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tiny Python Projects: 21 small fun projects for Python beginners designed to build programming skill, teach new algorithms and techniques, and introduce software testing"
"Using Manning's MEAP program, I read the ""Tiny Python Projects"" book and worked through all the problems.  I have been looking for a book like this for a long time.This book is the first I've read that gets past the beginning phases of learning Python and teaches you the nuts and bolts of using the language. I have been introduced to maps, regular expressions, argparse, etc. before, but without real examples and explanations on how to use them. After reading this book, I can now incorporate them into my thinking and my programming.I also really like the new.py template that the author introduces. I use it now, and it saves time. I am a big fan of automation.I like to see how a program works. Along with the command-line help, documented code, and small functions, I find that a test suite can explain functionality very well. I often have to go into source code to see how a function or method works because there is no context for using it in the documentation. I need to know how the function works in a specific situation and how it helps me do what I need. A well-written test can show precisely how a function or module should and can work.  The author explains testing using the pytest module and provides code on GitHub.As I mentioned before, most books give you a simplistic explanation of code and no actual working examples of how to use a module or library. This book goes beyond the beginner's basics and moves to the ""next step"" by supplying full code examples with explanations. Real, well-written code is pure gold. I highly recommend this very well written and example-driven book. I enjoyed going through the exercises and learning about coding choices.  This book will help you progress in your programming journey and make it fun at the same time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tiny Python Projects: 21 small fun projects for Python beginners designed to build programming skill, teach new algorithms and techniques, and introduce software testing"
"I love the concept of the book, and it's implemented pretty well. The book has a light touch and the author-drawn cartoons look professional and are to the point. So why the three stars?First, if you're a Windows user, this book is NOT for beginners. Is the book for beginners? The first project is ""Hello, World!"" so I assume it is. But casually remarking ""you might want to install Python under WSL"" is not something a beginner will figure out. However, the code in the book will NOT run if you don't.Second, there's a lot of complexity early on in the book, due to getting started with unit tests right from the start. While that's defensible under ""teach it right from the beginning"" it does clash with the earlier mentioned problem - if there's an example function then why are the tests written for Linux only (worst offense: hard-coded linux paths instead of using os or pathlib to make it system independent)With a few editorial changes and a more critical look at the code used in the book this could haven been a well deserved five stars, but making the code inaccessible for beginning coders under windows (and not mentioning so in the title or description) makes me limit the rating.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Tiny Python Projects: 21 small fun projects for Python beginners designed to build programming skill, teach new algorithms and techniques, and introduce software testing"
"This book teaches excellent coding practices from the beginning, helping you develop habits that will make your code robust (and professional!). I believe that is what sets this book apart from others. It will not teach you any fancy tricks or domain-specific magic, but rather give you a very solid foundation in Python coding, which can be generalized to other languages.Some examples of this are:Writing command-line executable scripts that take arguments. I have seen many beginners and even intermediate Python users hard coding too many things, such as data import paths. By passing in arguments, it makes the scripts more robust and forces you to think functionally.Introducing testing. Prior to this book, I thought that testing was only for the experts, and inaccessible to a beginner. That is not the case, and this book highlights how easy and useful testing can be when it is kept simple.Beside teaching good coding practice, this book gives a broad tour of Python, helping you gain insight to how Python behaves and many simple object types.The biggest downside of this book is as another review says: it can be difficult to get started on Windows. However, this is not a problem unique to this book; that is generally true for using Python on Windows. If you intend to use this book on Windows, I definitely recommend looking into installing WSL as the author says.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tiny Python Projects: 21 small fun projects for Python beginners designed to build programming skill, teach new algorithms and techniques, and introduce software testing"
"I have dabbled in and out of Python - copying code here and there, refactoring existing work from my team. But I wouldn't have considered myself a ""python programmer"" that can go execute my own ideas. Well, this book has allowed me to gain exponential confidence as a python programmer. I've heard Ken say this book can move you from a level 1 or 2 to a level 5, and this is 100% accurate. I am on my way. I'm about half way through the book and I've gone through all of the lessons (without cheating or skipping ahead). One thing I love about this book is how Ken built out the Git repo to go along with the book, and provides tests for the script you build. Therefore, you get familiar with test-based development, but are also able to run a command to test your code and know whether you have written code that meets the requirements. This is extremely helpful because there is always more than one way to do something, so it allows flexibility to write code that works for you, while also knowing whether you should move on to the 'solution' or not. Without this, I would probably be doing this book ""half-a**"", if you will.

"My kids do NOT like learning things from books -- I guess it's a foreign concept to their generation -- so buying this as a 9th birthday present for my daughter was a risk. But she had really enjoyed learning Scratch, and it was the summer of 2020 so she had time on her hands, so I went for it. She certainly didn't make it though the whole thing, but on the whole I think it was worth it.The first few chapters of the book are very well done, presenting concepts through examples that a kid can easily follow along with using a Python interpreter.  (The book has advice on installing Python on different operating systems as well, by the way.) With an adult by her side -- either myself, who codes for a living but not in Python, or her mom, who took some programming classes but has forgotten a lot of it -- my daughter was able to try out all the little code examples and see for herself how things worked.  She was also able to experiment.  It helped that she had already learned how to type fairly well in school; this way of learning might be rough on kids who are not comfortable at the keyboard.After Chapter 7 (about functions and modules), my kid paused indefinitely. Among other things, the summer was over and she had to start school again. It may be just as well, because the next few chapters have issues in my opinion. Chapter 8 covers classes, including inheritance; I'm highly skeptical that this is a good idea at this point in a book of this level, so I probably would have advised her to skip it and come back when she had a motivation for learning it. Chapter 9 covers many of Python's built-in functions, in alphabetical order -- it would make a good reference but should probably also be skipped the first time through, although I didn't see any mention of that possibility in the text. Chapter 10 does a similar thing for some standard modules, most of which I expect a kid who had never done any other programming would not see the point of and would not learn anything from. A chapter on using tkinter for graphics comes next and rounds out Part I of the book.  Parts II and III are extended examples that work through coding up some simple games. I wonder if it would be better to move this content earlier, or else let the reader know when it is safe to skip ahead.Overall, my family had a good experience with this book.  My 9-year-old made it about 1/3 of the way through before setting it aside, but it's here when she wants to pick it up again.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Kids: A Playful Introduction To Programming
"This Fall, I plan to teach an after-school Python course at our local public school to 4th and 5th graders and I have selected ""Python for Kids"" to form the content. I had looked at a few books on teaching kids programming and on learning python and Jason Briggs' book stands out for several reasons.It makes programming and Python in particular accessible to kids with no experience with either. One of the great challenges in teaching kids is shedding assumptions about language, knowledge, perspective etc. that adults take for granted.  Jason does this very well without talking down or dumbing down.I also found the book to be paced well with a balance of challenge (concepts and coding tasks) and support (explanations and help).  When new terms or programming concepts arise, Jason makes sure to introduce them so nothing goes over your head.The first 12 chapters are a basic introduction to the language and to programming concepts and the last 6 take the reader through two programming tasks of increasing difficulty.The first task is the creation of a ""Bounce!"" game - it takes 2 chapters (21 pages) to teach and about 100 lines of code. It is a primitive ""breakout/pong"" style game and really a fair amount of payoff for the effort the budding programmer must put in.The second program is called ""Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit"" and is a bit more advanced/involved.  It takes 4 chapters (62 pages) to cover and about 260 lines.  It has more complexity but most challenging thing is that for a lot of the code, you can not run it to check your work as you go.  I had a bug in my code that took me a bit of effort to find before I got it working perfectly.  However, Jason has a companion web site with all code snippets in the book including these last two projects and the code example he provided there helped my find the error I had made.I am very grateful to Jason for writing the book I was looking for.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Kids: A Playful Introduction To Programming

"[20160713 - Initial Review]I think the gaming ""angle"" to learning a programming language is great.  You have fun and you learn.  I was like a little kid showing my 8 and 9 year old sons the games I had created.  =_)I enjoyed the idea of creating squares and circles and stars, etc, etc, as you can really get an idea of the using modules, classes, objects, functions and for me especially loops.  I did stop at chapter 11 of 18.  The first 11 chapters really helped me understand a lot about using python.  I did not read through the remaining chapters because I don't need python for gaming in my work world but for file manipulation.  I'm sure I'll be looking over the remaining chapters in the future if I need to reference some logic in those chapters that can help me.

"Python For Kids, teaches you all about the code, python. Its really good because everything is step-by-step, everything is gradually getting more difficult as the author teaches you the basics of Python. It goes in depth in the descriptions and explanations, giving you a clear understanding on how Python works and how to use Python. Starting at the smallest step or instructions or like the first thing to know about Python, the author explains everything, very detailed, and shows you examples, explanations, and more. Closing the end, Python For Kids, get into making real games, to show you the code behind some common or well-known games (I know bounce is one), also giving you an idea on how to create your own game.

"I liked this book since it gave my 7 year-old grandson (and his grandpa) an immediate start to programming in Python. Clear instructions start off with the down-load of the interpreter language. It also very quickly differentiates between programming at the command line (shell) level versus creating a file and then running the code you've created.I've professionally used a couple old languages for many years in creating accounting-related programs for small business and small government clients. But I want to learn  a data-oriented high level modern language. Hopefully, Python will serve this purpose. But it will also give my grandson an ability to create his own game software based on what I saw in later chapters in this ""kids"" book.The weakness in this book became quickly obvious to me as I tried to find ways to code in Python what I already could do in another language. A critical function, for example, the input command, doesn't even have an entry in the index. Similarly, the ability to combine strings and variables in a print command wasn't obvious.One of the concerns I have is that some code written at the Python version 2 level won't run at the version 3 level interpreter. Microsoft did this early on with their Visual Basic language. As someone who is familiar with the incredible stability of the Cobol language (e.g., I still have clients running code today that I wrote in the very early 1980's using the CP/M operating system before the IBM PC was even invented), the potential nightmare of having to re-code large programs isn't appealing. We'll see what happens. For me, I need a different book with a much better index.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Kids: A Playful Introduction To Programming

"I don't always give 5 stars, but when I do, it's for real. Stay coding my friends! Actually, I'm only about half way through the book, but I felt I had to do the review now. After dumping MicroShaft and getting into Linux, I could no longer use VisualBASIC; I had to choose another language and it came down to ""C"" or Python. I chose Python because I wanted to do some real work without trudging through a 3 year learning curve. Python is, as they say, easy to pick up, especially if you have prior coding experience.You should know the basic Python syntax and structure, basic commands etc., before starting this book; it isn't a ""beginners 1st Python"" book. But one or two of the ""24 hour"" or ""1 day"" starter books will be sufficient. Also, this book is intended for people who want to get into serious math and graphics. If you are into science, engineering, etc., this is for you.VERY well written and laid out; also, it isn't a big scary 600 page monster that might be intimidating to pick up and start - it's only 200 pages and there is no wasted space. A lot is said in minimal volume (I always like that). You will continue to learn Python as you proceed; also you will learn about math, graphics, and some physics as well. Most important - you will see how you can use Python to solve real world math problems and apply this to whatever you are doing.It starts out simple with basic math functions, then rapidly progresses to graphing equations, then statistics; later on complex graphics (fractals - my thing), and calculus. Right now this is brain workout and fun for me, but I hope to use it later for work. The book is very easy to follow as you move along. You should use an interactive python editor (like Idle3) rather than try to run from the command line, although you can do that if you want.One thing you can do is copy all the code snippets [after understanding them <g> and perhaps modifying a little] and collect them all in a personal python module which you can then use forever. Also, as you run the code snippets and play with them as you proceed through the book, you can experiment and modify / run them on the spot – this is a good way to learn – to stamp it into your brain in a way you will remember.Fairly early in the book is a function which calculates and then graphically plots the trajectory of a thrown baseball; the technique is the same for any projectile. I was able to modify it a bit, put it in a loop, and graph the trajectory(s) for an object thrown at all angles from 0->90*. I was thus able to “prove” graphically something that is already well known – all other factors equal, a projectile will travel farthest when launched up at a 45* angle. Cool!If you are in a science or engineering field and want to learn Python for that - I can't over-recommend this book!Cheers.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Doing Math with Python: Use Programming to Explore Algebra, Statistics, Calculus, and More!"
"This book is best used by high school students as an adjunct to their math, statistics, and physics courses. It could also be used by other learners particularly self learners. The excercises are well thought out and the answers with code are downloadable. This is a wonderful feature, however,  there will always  be the risk that  learners may be tempted  to download the code before they try to write it themselves. It is nice to see the code for calculating mean, median, mode, and variance without just using Excel or SPSS and plugging your data in. The excercises in chapter 3 allow these statistical functions to be placed in a module which can be called subsequently. I would strongly recommend using Anaconda as it has the matplotlib and sympy modules  easily called. I encountered major error codes when I tried using Pycharm with Python 3.9.  These appear to be path errors which I was not able to fix. I was able to use Pycharm if I used Anaconda running with Python 3.8. The author has listed several errata which can be found through the publisher's website. Overall I have been enjoying the book. I remember  in high school having to do the calculations by hand demonstrating Newton's law and the graphics of throwing projectiles. The scientific calculators were not available until my first year of college in 1972. I am only disappointed that more time is not spent on trigonometric functions and Fourier analysis. More time should also be spent on complex variables and Euler's function. All high school students contemplating engineering and physics majors in college would appreciate this. The appendix documenting installing Anaconda needs to be updated and the errata fixed in the next edition. Making the solutions and code for the excercises is wonderful.

"This book would be great, except, it requires that you have software called Anaconda.  That was not immediately evident to me reading the book’s description.  I thought all you needed was Python.Anaconda is free, and would probably be easy enough to load on a full size machine.  It’s a problem, however, for a Raspberry Pi.I had purchased this book with the idea of having fun programming my Raspberry Pi.  That worked until Chapter 2, where programs then called Anaconda functions.I hate to give this book a 1 star, but I want to get anyone’s attention who might be under the same misimpression I was.

"Full disclosure, I've worked with and have been mentored by Doug for 20 years or so.  I have been developing software in various programming languages for about as long.  In that time, I've read numerous books on the subject.  I've always found the author's style and progression as important to my comprehension as the material.  Doug does an excellent job at both.  He is highly skilled and loves to share his knowledge.  Through his writing, Doug acts as a mentor who wants to see you succeed.

"I wasn't sure what to expect but I think the author did a superb job in both presentation and content. The range of Python is covered here in examples, from the basics of naming conventions to web programming with Flask, a topic not always covered to this depth. This is not a book I would recommend for a novice; some prior engineering experience in Python or another OOP, server-side language is recommended before consuming this book. Great examples and an easy-to-follow format. I was delighted and really didn't find any cons with this. Excellent job for a first book!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Well-Grounded Python Developer
"Disclaimer: I am one of the manuscript reviewers for the book.You probably have figured out this book is not targeted at novice Python developers even though they may as well benefit from it.For intermediate to pro Python developers, this book covers important topics to help develop applications and thus it talks about important concepts such as exceptions (probably the best explanation of exception I have read), namespaces, etc and internet tools such as flask, templates etc. and also some topics you might not find from typical python programming books: data persistence and login, authentication...I found it most help if one just glance over or read through it once and then pick up the topic interested and then delve into it for details. This way, it will improve your python developing skills tremendously and help become domain expert in that area. If you somehow manage to have a decent grasp of most of the materials, it sure will help you have a solid foundation in understanding of python development.The only suggestion or wish I have is that this book has more content covered. Given the style the author has for this book, it will certainly help python developers even more.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Well-Grounded Python Developer
"I have been programming for four decades. In my profession career, I loved programming in Python the most. It is a beautiful programming language. Recently I started teaching my high schooler daughter who isn't interested in math or computer science about Python programming. Ability to program is a good skill to have in all walks of life. Luckily I came across the Well Grounded Python Developer recently. This book helped me tremendously in explaining Functional Programming, Object Oriented Programming concepts to her. She understood the examples given. I wanted her to take Harvard University EdX course CS 50, but that was too much of a time commitment for a teenager. This book became an invaluable resource for her to learn at her pace. I recommend this book for novice and intermediate Python developers.

"....That isn't an early Mel Brooks or Richard Lester movie! This film pretty much made me a fan of the Pythons, leading me to go see a retrospective of theirs including ""And Now For Something Completely Different"", ""Jabberwocky"" and ""Monty Python & The Holy Grail"". By far the most ingenious and well written thing they've done since and maybe SLIGHTLY funnier than ""Grail"", this movie makes fun of zealotry, hypocrisy, decadence, dumb luck and history, all in one fell swoop!The movie generally involves a case of mistaken identity that affects a Nazarene named Brian, born on the same day as, and right downstream from, you-know-who. This mistake affects Brian's life through the course of the entire movie, even after he joins a fanatic sect of Roman-hating terrorists. Though the Wise Men who mistook him for Jesus early in the film corrected themselves, Brian still has a hard time convincing the sheepish, desperate people who follow him everywhere that he isn't a messiah while trying to escape Roman capture.Cleese, Idle and Palin especially shine in this film, playing many disparate parts...Cleese as 1) A Roman centurion, 2) Reg, the leader of a terrorist faction Brian happens onto, and 3) A high priest/Pharisee/Sadducee - whatever, holding a zany trial for someone who has said the Lord's name in vain; Idle as: 1) Stan, a terrorist with gender identity problems, 2) A crazy but extremely lucky guy who never gets crucified though he's due for it, 3) A guy who taunts a fellow at the sermon on the mount by repeatedly calling him ""Bignose"", 4) A stuttering gravedigger, 5) A stoning rock, false beard and gourd vendor and 6) The guy who sings ""Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life"" to Brian while hanging from a cross; Palin plays: 1) Pontius Pilate, 2) a particularly zealous member of the terrorist band Brian joins, 2)A squirrelly beggar complaining about being cured, 3) a VERY mild-mannered head counter at Brian's crucifiction, 4) The guy Idle taunts at the sermon on the mount and 5) A verbose false prophet. Even Chapman, the one playing Brian, also plays the role of Biggus Dickus, the lisping friend of Pontius Pilate as well as the hapless ""Red Sea pedestrian"" himself. Terry Jones plays Brian's mother and an ascetic who has his vow of silence ruined by Brian stepping on his foot.When I first saw this movie, I didn't remember laughing so much since seeing Richard Lester's ""Help!"" and ""Hard Day's Night"" at the Circle In The Square up in Greenwich Village back in 1967. A true masterpiece of zany comedy as only the British seem able to do it.Wouldn't it be great to see either Rowan Atkinson's or ""Grant/Naylor's"" take on religion? The possibilities are endless!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Life Of Brian - The Immaculate Edition [Blu-ray]
"I knew I had to see this movie immediately after watching The Meaning of Life, which unleashes three sketches of scathing (and did I mention hilarious?) satire at the expense of Catholicism and Protestantism.  On that note, I would like to point out that the comedy of Monty Python is so brilliantly funny NOT because its punchlines target God or the teachings of Jesus, but rather the innate flaws of the very Human institutions that mandate them.  To this end, anyone with faith who can recognize and identify with the very stupidity that separates humans from God in the first place should be able to laugh along WITH the Pythons.  Unfortunately, the controversy from some of the more sensitive religious reviewers posted on this site led me to believe that The Life of Brian would contain more of the same spot on satire as contained in The Meaning of Life.  Any religious satire contained in this movie, however, was subtle at best.  Though funny, even brilliant at parts, the humor of this movie is centered more around life in Biblical TIMES rather than actual Biblical EVENTS.  This fact also, strangely enough, leads me to assume that some of the people submitting reviews of this film ... like, i don't know, say the guy who thought he had the moral authority to declare that Graham Chapman's death from cancer was inflicted by God as a direct consequence for making this movie ... have never even seen it.  But I guess that this is the exact brand blind ignorance the movie is ultimately making fun of, isn't it?  So I guess the joke is on you.At any rate, although the movie gets even funnier with familiarity and offers its share of classic Python scenes (the Biggus Diccus, Haggling, and Stoning scenes all had me in stitches), I preffered both The Meaning of Life and The Holy Grail to The Life of Brian because of the greater variety of humor offered in the hodge-podge of shorter storylines.  But it's definitely worth watching ... and if you're a fan: the extras on the criterion collection make it worth owning. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.  And maybe if you're lucky, God won't even smite you if you chuckle here and there.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Life Of Brian - The Immaculate Edition [Blu-ray]
"Somewhere in my history I lost or lent my copy to someone. Realized in a conversation with an adult niece, many in her generation no nothing of python. Purchased a copy for my library so family could watch it, and I can rewatch it.

"If you're considering buying this DVD (the Criterion Collection), chances  are you already know this movie, so I don't want to belabour the plot  points that others have done before me, except to echo that this is a great  (and funny) movie.  Instead, I will focus on the extras that the DVD  offers, so you can decide if you want to spend the extra money.There are  a plethora of extras, including a couple of commentaries (the commentary  with Cleese and Palin is superior to that of Jones, Gilliam, and Idle,  IMHO), some cut scenes, and even the radio ads.  The cut scenes even have  commentaries!  The scenes that were cut in the final edit probably deserve  to be cut, but for different reasons.  There is an opening scene with  shepherds that simply drags on and isn't particularly funny.  A bunch of  stuff cut from the kidnapping of Pilate's wife scene, which is a little  confusing and goes on too long, and the intro scene to the Suicide Squad  that appears at the end of the movie.  This scene is, for me, far more  offensive than anything that finally appeared in the movie (a Jewish-Nazi  resistance group, complete with a speech on the ethnic purity).  It is also  very funny, but you feel uncomfortable laughing at it.There are also  some British radio ads that are amusing, and a fairly in-depth featurette  on the making of the movie.  Some of the issues raised in the making-of  feature are repeated in the commentary(ies), but it's still  interesting.Thus, this DVD has it all for the Monty Python fan - the  movie itself, the commentaries and featurette that give the background on  the story and info on how and why scenes were shot, some nifty scenes cut  from the movie, and those radio ads.  Good value for the price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Life Of Brian - The Immaculate Edition [Blu-ray]
"I first saw this movie ages ago, and through the years completely forgot about its existence. Then I watched the Monty Python documentary ""Almost the Truth"" and they talked about this movie and showed clips from it. That brought back the memories and I realized I must have this film for my collection.I'm not gonna go into great detail about the film itself. If you haven't seen it by now, I can't help you. Buy the damn Blu-Ray (or DVD if you prefer), and see it. It is absolutely amazing and is some of the finest work the Monty Python crew has ever done. I love absolutely every single second of this film, and if you don't, you are probably a bad person. I strongly believe that the people who don't like this movie are the reason we can't have nice things.On to the Blu-Ray then. I bought this particular edition because of the stellar reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. The picture and sound quality is great. The only complaint (if you want to call it that) that I have is the menu. The writing on the menu can be a little difficult to make out at first glance, but it's not really that big of a deal.I haven't checked out the commentary or any of the other special features because honestly I don't really care much about all that stuff. I bought the Blu-Ray for the movie, not for all the extra crap. Well worth the cash for the movie alone, all the special features notwithstanding. In the time it took you to read this review, you could've bought this movie. How can you live with yourself?",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Life Of Brian - The Immaculate Edition [Blu-ray]
"Life of Brain is a little over the top, but for a Python movie it is along ways bellow the top. Terry Jones directs (with terry Gilliam as visual desinger) this movie about the alternate Jesus. Brain was born in the stable next to Jesus's (as explained in a hilarious oppening scence invlolving the three wise men) and goes on to become an accidental Messiah. Brain is played by Grahm, and the other Pythons make continual, skit like appearances. Life of Brian is more of a movie than any of the other Monty Python escapades, but it still doesn't flow as well as a normal movie.If I wanted to get a freind into Monty Python, this is what I'd show them, most of the humor is something everyone will appreciate, and everyone I know (besdes me) who likes Monty Python says that this is their favorite of the movies (I like Holy grail best).On the DVD: It has a theatrical trailer (only one, and it is basicilly just movie clips, nothing new added). It has a making of documentery (it gives nice, detailed opinions of the Pythons, by the Pythons as well as an informative look at the way Life of brian was made). It has 5 deleated scences. These are poor quality, but not overlly so. These scences all have a two of the Pythons talking (on an optional audio track). The final, special feature is four British Radio adds involving the Python's mothers telling you to go see the movie.  The chapters are well organized and placed. There are two derictor cuts, one with Eric Idle (my personal favorite), Terry Jones, and terry Gilliam. The other has John Cleese and Micheal Palin (Grahm died in 1989 from cancer). These cuts are quite nice, pleanty of info about the movie, and some of the personal feeling about the movie in general or specific scences.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Life Of Brian - The Immaculate Edition [Blu-ray]
"""But I'm not the messiah! Go way!"" ...I swear I have laughed at MONTY PYTHONS stuff for years. The dry humor and Simi-slapstick is just endearingly hilarious. It seems I never get tired of it! And my son, (a very different generation indeed) finds this British wit hilarious as well, we wholeheartedly agree on this...one of the very rare things, believe that! It's clean fun. If a bit blasphemous, (ha ha). Review time:A man called Brian...not a very impressive name for, well, the supposed son of God. But Brian is just a young man trying to make the leap from adolescence to manhood and escape his mother's skirts (an ugly, but loving harlot played by Terry Jones) He unwittingly stumbles into circumstance after circumstance, that, - even though he tries to convince everyone he is just an ordinary guy- seems to thoroughly convince everyone that he is the second coming...a hero to save the masses, to brake the yoke of the Roman empire on the oppressed. The side busting antics are still bringing tears of laughter to my eyes and I've probably seen it, like, a hundred times! Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin, the core group of MP are all here and in their heyday. This IS comedy at it's best. And no gross outs, no farts,  no F bombs every other word...just plain Ol' brilliance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Life Of Brian - The Immaculate Edition [Blu-ray]
"To this day, I recall the frustration of failing a college course even though I worked hard and wanted to understand the material. The professor certainly seemed very intelligent. Thankfully, I passed after retaking the course a semester later. The difference was another professor who had a gift for explaining complicated material in a way that made sense to me. Jeff Prosise also has that gift.Don't let the book's title scare you into thinking that to understand its concepts, you have to be a nerd in a dark room drinking Mountain Dew until the odd hours of the night tinkering with code (Oh wait, that's me!), or, you have to be a data scientist or have degrees in advanced mathematics. It is approachable and understandable to anyone with a logical mind and the ability to use Google to define some terms that pop up here and there. I really think managers and CxOs who can't see the random forests for the decision trees will benefit the most in getting a grip on what this topic is all about. I will say something that may seem outrageous, but I think many of the readers here who like sci-fi could skip installing and running the code examples and come away being able to determine science fiction from fact in this topic.This book is broken into two parts: part 1 builds foundations, defines terms, and covers traditional machine learning (ML) and part 2 delves further into deep learning and building neural networks. The entire book has wonderful, real-world examples. It uses the most popular tools like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow for building machine learning models. It also uses Python for most code examples with a few things in C# for ML.Net and some client examples.I appreciate the real-world examples like predicting taxicab arrivals or credit fraud that connect with actions people perform day to day. The audio classification example, which uses sound files with a convolutional neural network, is fascinating and creative. The chapters covering facial and object recognition were favorites; I had more than a couple of ""aha"" moments because Jeff did such a great job building on the basics from the beginning. Have you ever wondered how self-driving cars avoid hitting objects? The chapter on Natural Language Processing interested me because I use Duolingo every day in my study of Portuguese as a third language, and I've wondered how the language processor works. Hey, I have a clue now!The book concludes with a tour of Azure Cognitive Services and a final example that is simple and elegant using the Contoso Travel company so many Microsoft developers are familiar with from demos. Speaking of demos, if you want to follow the examples, Jeff has done a great job of explaining how to set up the environment and even created the Docker container image with everything you need to make it simple. I also learned to use Flask to wrap a Python Model in a web service and call it from a C# client. Way cool! Now I can say I'm busy training my model without HR getting upset... but I digress.Thank you, Jeff, for an excellent book!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers: Solve Business Problems That Can't Be Solved Algorithmically

"Edward Loper's book is an introduction to the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for the Python programming language.  Its target audience is a narrow one.  It assumes a working familiarity with Python.  It's true that an experienced programmer could learn Python along the way, but getting the most from the code examples and walkthrough explanations requires enough familiarity to ""think"" in Python.  The book also assumes sufficient familiarity with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand why one would want to build lexicons, grammars, and parsers.The book has several strengths.  It is tightly integrated with Python and NLTK code.  There are numerous examples throughout and the author walks through and modifies them to clarify how the NLTK works.  The sizeable reference sections at the end of each chapter are also valuable.  These sections include both introductory and advanced sources.  And a lot of them.  There is also useful integration with the NLTK web site which provides and points to additional resources.Not to be missed are the end-of-chapter questions.  Readers have come to expect little from these learning aids; they usually invite us to parrot back a small number of key concepts or try a few calculations or code segments.  This book's questions go far beyond the norm.  They introduce new concepts, encourage writing and comparing several versions of a program, and otherwise extend each chapter's contents.  Even readers who don't plan to complete these exercises should read them closely.Weaknesses are few.  As noted, the book may assume too much Python and NLP background for some users.  It does have a narrow focus and is not organized the right way to be used as a reference book.  Readers who want something a little more modular and reference-like might prefer Jacob Perkins'

"If you already know what's in this book, it's probably a great book.  But if you don't, it's not.I've been programming in C and C++ for around 15 years.  I taught computer science at Stanford.  I write crosswords for the New York Times.  Neither programming nor language is new to me.  But I found it very difficult (nigh on impossible) to learn anything from this book.  I couldn't learn about NLTK effectively, and I couldn't learn about Python, either.  I bought the book to learn both; imagine my disappointment!In both cases, the reason is that the book is organized from a ""let's do this, let's do that"" perspective.  If you want to do exactly what the authors did, that's great.  But if you want to do something different, it's terrible.  As a representative example, exercise 2.8.13 mentions, ""You can get all noun synsets using wn.all_synsets('n').""That's great to know.  But why is the only indication of a piece of useful functionality sitting inside an exercise?  There needs to be a well thought-out layout: ""Here are all the pieces of NLTK.  Here is what each piece does.  Here is what the submethods are and how they work.""  As it stands, if I want to do something new, I have to either write it myself or just guess as to whether it's functionality that NLTK provides.The treatment of python is sadly similar.  Python depends heavily on something called a ""list comprehension"".  List comprehensions are used throughout the book.  But their syntax, from a programming perspective, is never defined.  Having read (and reread) much of this book, I can say with confidence that I still don't understand how they work.  Given my programming background, I would think I would have a much better understanding having spent so much time trying to figure it out.Again, there needs to be structure.  ""This is what's in Python.  This is what it all means, one piece at a time.""You can find this book online for free; I read it that way the first time, got confused, and figured buying a paper copy would help.  Sadly, it didn't.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit
"Buy this book only if you:  1. Know the basics of natural language processing (NLP) or linguistics;  2. Know the Python programming language or you're willing to learn it;  3. Are using the NLTK library or plan to do so.NLTK is a Python library that offers many standard NLP tools (tokenizers, POS taggers, parsers, chunkers and others). It comes with samples of several dozens of text corpora typically used in NLP applications, as well as with interfaces to dictionary-like resources such as WordNet and VerbNet. No FrameNet, though. NLTK is well documented, so you might not need this book initially. However, it definitely helps to have it on your desk if you are serious about using NLTK.The first chapters are a bit messy, as they attempt to introduce all three themes (NLP, NLTK and Python) together. Beginners may have some difficulty sorting things out. By the time you reach the WordNet section, you either got lost in the forest, realize that you would never understand this topic without the book, or both. However, if you are a bit patient and try out all simple code examples, you'll make it eventually. In my opinion, NLTK remains the simplest, most elegant and well rounded library of its kind.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit
"NLTK was originally designed for teaching NLP, but because NLTK is so comprehensive, it is also quite vast, and you will need a guide to get you started on using it effectively. This book is that guide. Its organized into 4 sections. Chapters 1-4 cover the basics; 5-7 covers language processing, tagging, classification and information extraction; Chapters 8-10 covers sentence parsing, syntax, structure and representations of meaning, and Chapter 11 covers managing linguistics data. If you are looking to get an overview of NLP, as well as reasonable proficiency in manipulating text and extracting information from it, this book may be for you. People who are not NLP specialists but need to use NLP techniques at work will find this book particularly helpful. People who plan on specializing in NLP will probably find the book useful as a stepping stone into the field.My interest in NLP (and the book) is limited to being able to apply machine learning techniques to solve NLP problems, so I found the first two sections really useful. However, the entire book (including the exercises) is a great source of ideas on what you can accomplish in NLP with NLTK.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit
"My subject area background when I picked up this book was NLP 101, Python 201. Halfway through the book, I can say I am at NLP 201, Python 301. I really like the example-driven approach. It motivates me to write Python modules operating in a similar fashion to the examples but with heuristic changes (wherever applicable). It is a good journey of discovery and reinforcement of NLP concepts via a DIY approach. I do find that relatively complex concepts sneak up on you as you get deeper in the book. But you can always google for literature on areas, which do not have exhaustive coverage. And there is a decent amount of literature easily and/or freely available. Tip - it really helps to know your probability and statistics theory. To summarize, this book has sustained and grown my interest in NLP - an area with amazing opportunities and possibilities. And Python is a really elegant language. Thank you Steven Bird and team!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit
"I'm only halfway through chapter 2 and I'm absolutely in love with this book. I originally bought it because I was interested in how to sort text you can find on the web (blogs, tweets, news articles) into categories, but after I started reading it I realized that it could also be used to create a tool that would help people to come up with rap / poetry more quickly (which is something I've daydreamed about since high school).The book is extremely well-written: a plain-English style which is very easy to digest and looks effortless but which I'm sure actually required a lot of thought (speaking from experience). The order in which they're introducing topics is brilliant IMO (again, speaking from experience of having to teach a complicated new topic).Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit
"I am working on social network analysis and text mining. Of course, anyone can find the code pieces on the internet but this book provides a good framework for whoever wants to start working on text mining. The book is somewhat old (2009). For computer programming, even a year may make a book obsolete. However, the NLTK package is still one of the best beside other competitors like SpaCy. One important topic that the book does not cover is vectorization which is a relatively new topic. Overall, I enjoyed reading the book.

"I have no prior experience or knowledge of Python but after reading through the first two chapters everything just clicked from then on out. Learning curve is about two chapters for those who have no previous experience programming in Python. Plenty of examples from the book and exercises that makes reading, learning, and programming fun. I actually bought this book for a computer science course even though there is a free online version, but having a paperback copy allows for easier look-ups of codes and examples when working on the exercises, and I can easily read it at my leisure. Very detail and well written, just follow along with the examples from the book and you can't go wrong. Easy to learn. Fun to program.

"Finally, an intro programming book that is entertaining.  The example projects are useful.  Actually useful.  And, quick to program.I have been programming for many years. I have been working with databases for the past 8 years, so my other programming skills have not kept pace mostly because I have no specific day to day use for Python or any other non-database language in my job.  But, for some unknown reason, I wanted to learn Python.  So, I tried a number of the usual ""Learn Python in 36 Seconds"" intro methods -- books and on-line tutorials.  Boring.  So, I would put in a one or two hours and never return.When I got ""Automate the Boring Stuff"", I skimmed over the intro: basic Python syntax chapters.  Then, I hit the projects.  I quickly realized my error when I could not remember basic syntax:  like put that dreaded colon at the end of an IF or FOR statement.  Every language wants to do that differently for some reason.  So, I re-started the intro chapters.  But, I quickly got back to the projects.  First project was a copy to the clipboard task.  Cool technology.  Not exceptionally useful, but entertaining.  And, it sure beat the heck out of the usual intro chapters of beginner books.  By the time I hit the Excel chapter, I was hooked.  And, automating data into and out Excel had a very high appeal to me.  I have now completed 2 Excel projects of my own complete with modules to support the code. Each of my projects will save hours of tedious work every month.  Also, I learned the limits of the Python Excel module:  openpyxl.  That was frustrating -- but a very good indicator that I had actually learned it.  And, that pesky colon syntax now naturally comes at the end of IF and FOR statements -- another good indicator that I had learned something.I have to recommend this book to anyone who gets bored trying to learn a new language.  Based on how the material is presented, this book should also serve well for first time programmers.  And, automating a few tedious tasks does not hurt.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners
"This is a great book for those who know how to use computer basics but are super beginners to programming in general.There are some issues I have with the book's methods, but I am giving it 5 stars because the author explicitly mentions these defects as an intentional part of the book, and the methods still really helped me get to the ""meat"" of programing basics.The book takes you through the basics of programming with python, a bit of history about the language, and takes the user through some of the most common functions. Sweigart explains the definitions of basic concepts, such as strings, integers, functions...etc...There are lots of review sessions and the projects at the end of the chapters really help you work out the syntax on your own.As the book progresses into more and more complex usages of the language all the while giving the user great examples of potential uses for programming for general office use, or as time saving techniques.The Pros:-easy to read, to the point but with enough description to teach you the concepts.-great introduction to programming in general, as well as the language-a supplemental website and reddit forum that can really help users with some of the concepts of the book.The Cons:-the style leaves out some common programming rules I discovered with supplemental work (he openly admits this is done to keep to the basics of syntax and language usage, it is an effective way to teach newbies).-some things should have had a little more attention. I feel the role of functions is so big, there should have been a little more emphasis on the scope of the use of the functionsI would highly recommend this book if you:A. are looking to do programming but do not know where to startandB. are comfortable with computers (you don't have to know the command line or be able ot build one from the ground up, but know how to use basic functions)C. Don't mind the stripped down explanation of things, sticking to concepts rather than form, or the ""do's and don'ts"" of proper usage",5.0 out of 5 stars,Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners
"I am only a chapter into this book, but it has so far been the best programming book I have yet read. His examples are clear, and he does not just say, ""now add x between a and b"" as previous coding books have done, instead he lays out the code line by line, notes the line which code is on, and references the lines as he goes through it. He even repeats the code several times in examples in order to address different issues and explains why some things don't work. I feel as if, unlike other books I have read from other publishing companies, that No Starch Press actually proofreads and tests what they are putting into the world, and I think this author actually understands how to communicate and teach via a written medium.As I have moved further into this book, I can re-confirm my thoughts on it: It is by far the best programming book I have read. I have not yet encountered any errors or mistakes in it, and the author wrote his code and explained it line by line so that even someone as inexperienced as I am can learn from the code. I will absolutely be purchasing future books from No Starch Press as they publish quality material.I have moved further into this book, and I am still convinced that it is the best programming book I have read. While there are still points at which I am confused, or stumble, these are no way the fault of the author; but rather my own shortcomings and lack of experience with various aspects of computer programming.

"I bought this book with the hopes that it would allow me to automate certain aspects of my workload. I’m happy to say that it ended up being exactly what I was looking for. I especially enjoyed the chapters on web scraping and working with Excel and CSV files (a large chunk of my workload is manipulating Excel files). I was able to write Python scripts that save me time and keep me from having to drudge through mundane tasks at work.If you do anything at work that sounds like this, then you have boring stuff you can automate: “…go to this website, enter these credentials and download these files.”“…open these Excel files, format them this way, then save a copy over here.”“…each month create these new folders. Grab these documents and place them in the new folders and email these people.”I’m not new to programming (and I’m no expert either), but I feel anyone with anyone with a basic exposure to programming concepts will understand everything in this book without issue.

"I'm an electrical engineer who programs a lot both at my job and at home. My non-programmer sister wants to learn how to code and I was interested in learning Python both for work and hobbies, so I picked this up to teach myself and evaluate as a gift for her. Needless to say, I'm pretty satisfied with it and I expect that my sister will be too.Python is a fantastic language for beginning programmers and Sweigart does a great job of explaining it. The only beef I had with it is that some of the humor in the book may interfere with comprehension. Humor is great to keep readers engaged and help prevent them from stressing out about stuff that can be intimidating, but there are a few times here where I felt the quality of explanation suffered a little to squeeze in a joke or geek-culture reference. Note that my complaint is minor enough to not warrant taking a star off of the rating.The book's focus on automation in the second half is fantastic. Most other programming books that I have used are no where near as pragmatic and it's great to be able to apply your new knowledge to your own life immediately.

"""Automate the Boring Stuff..."" is a bad way to start the title for a great book on programming in Python.

"I am a beginner with respect to programming, and do not have a particularly technical background:  I know almost no math though I know formal logic pretty well.  I was interested in learning something about computer programming just for fun and have looked through a number of books about a number of languages.  I even spent some time with C before I decided on Python.  To an absolute beginner, it seemed a relatively intuitive language without some of the messy detail required by C, for example, about memory allocation.  I chose this book simply because it looked fun and very clear.  Each chapter focuses on tools needed to create games.  I do not have any interest at all in playing computer games of any kind, but it is a relatively painless way to learn Python.  I also found the exercises at the end of each chapter very good.  They are hard enough but not too hard.  They generally required a fair amount of time and effort, but I was able to finally figure out all of them. This is important since I am doing this on my own.The Cons:  The book aims to be simple and brief, but sometimes it is too simple and brief.  Yes I learned to get the computer to do this or that, but I did not fully get some of the concepts.  In fact, I think the book moved on to fancy stuff like graphics before I got down all I needed of the basics such as file control.  Perhaps someone who already knew something about programming would have had less trouble.  For example, the material on writing to a file stored on the hard drive for future use was fine, as far as it went.  But I realized, when trying to write a program of my own, that I did not understand a key point.  If you have recorded some data to a file, and then want to revise that data, Python rewrites the entire file.  Huh?  What about my original data?  It gets over written. There has to be a solution to this problem, but I did not find it in the book.  After hours of work I devised a way to get the right result, but it was very messy and, when I posted a question on a Python forum, I found there was a simple way to do what I wanted.  Maybe I am a bit thick, but I think this could have been directly covered in the book.  There were several other topics that needed more discussion.Still, keeping in mind that this book only goes so far, it is a very good introduction to Python.  But if you are serious about learning Python, at some point, you are going to need one of those big fat and far more boring books.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition"
"First, to correct some misconceptions:The Python language environment is available for free at python dot org.  To get the latest version, this is where to get it from.It comes pre-installed on Mac's, and most versions of Linux.  HOWEVER, this book (3rd edition) requests that you do the exercises in version 3.1.x.The Mac, and most Linux machines come with version 2.5.x or 2.6.x right now.  So you will want to download 3.1 even if Python is pre-installed on your machine.Windows doesn't come with Python pre-installed, so just select the 3.1.x version for x86 computers.  The installer is EXCELLENT.I tested it on WinXP, Vista, Win7, Mac OS X, and Ubuntu Linux, and all are usable.Note that with WIN and Mac, when you save a file, you must put the .py extension when saving.  Linux does it for you.The digital version exercises are hard to find.  The book points you to the website, but not where they are on the site.  One of the menu picks on the bottom of the screen will get you headed in the right direction.  This is why I gave it 4 stars.  Something like that should not be busted on a fairly new book.====================================================================Review:I was a commercial programmer from 1977-1992.  So I had some experience with programming and know several languages.  My children are 10 and 12 with no programming exposure.  I wanted to teach them programming since it is not offered at their school.  I picked Python since it's a high-level language that supports OOP (object oriented prog) yet can be used without it.From the first day, it had the kids begging for more, and Dad wasn't bored either.  Yes, some of it is a bit (yawn) for me, but it was necessary for the kids to avoid confusion.  The tasks use games as examples, which makes the lessons less tedious, if not outright fun.  There are homework challenges at the end of each chapter, and working source code for the lesson tasks should you get lost.Whether there is a better book, I cannot say.  But I do know it's about as good of a textbook as they come in my experience.If you are an experienced programmer, just make your tasks a bit harder, but do read every page.  There is often a bit of humor, or a little insight that makes it worth the read.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition"
"Python Programming by Michael Dawson is a very well written book intended to enthuse amateur programmers into the world of video game programming. By the time you finish chapter 12 of this book you will be ready to create your own mini games much similar to games you find on apps on phones and such. For those of you who want this immediate pleasure I have to say, this is the book for you and disregard my poor rating. But for those who really want to get down to the nitty-gritty basics of python and develop a solid understanding of it, this is not the book for you. So if you're a programmer who dreams of being a game developer one day, I say buy this book right away - it's fun. But if you're looking for a more formal approach to programming and aren't necessarily interested in the gaming aspect of Python Programming read on.Let me tell you why I think this book deserves only 3 stars. A bit of background, I started researching with particle physicists and astronomers at my school and programming python was much required so I decided I wanted a solid understanding of creating basic python scripts. What I ended up getting was a unorganized book that seemed to toss in information only for the soul purpose of creating a game at the end of each chapter. This was very bearable for the first 3-5 chapters but after that I couldn't get through a single chapter without having to scroll through multiple pages to find what a certain thing does because of it's lack of structure. It also lacks direction, it teaches you enough to get through the chapter but doesn't let you spread your wings and become creative with the script, by this I mean that it teaches you the very basics and moves on without getting a bit creative with the code. Also, there doesn't seem to be summaries which I feel, at least in programming, are essential because after you learn something and got it down you just want to reference it quickly. All in all I felt very dissapointed because the idea behind the teaching method is fun, but it fails at being rigorous and theoretical which is what I wanted.So like I said, disregard this review if you're looking to have fun with programming which is 100% fine, but if you want to get more professional about writing scripts that don't involve programming games, I suggest another book (wish I could recommend one). Remember though, a book is what you make of it.P.S. The downloadable content is online, just google the book name and author, maybe even the publisher - it's online.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition"
"The majority of this book is written as if it is intended to teach a twelve year old to program in Python.  It is way too wordy and simplistic for the amount of material actually covered, and you may end up skipping over much of it to just get to the point. To some that may be a good thing, to others a bad thing. You can decide that for yourself. But when the book gets to Object Oriented Programming, it goes from being overly simplistic to not explaining the material well enough. It's as if too much space in the book was used up being overly simplistic and repetitive in the beginning, so there wasn't enough space to explain OOP later on.I may have given it 4 stars because the title does accurately reflect the content (for the absolute beginner) and because I did learn a lot from this book, but I gave it three stars (which is still generous) for the following reasons:There are numerous errors in this book and many quite glaring and obvious (page 62 for example) that easily should have been caught by anyone proofing this book. It seems like the publisher of the book never read it. There is severe lack of coordination between the content of the book and the website. There is an errata page on the website for other editions, but I didn't find one for this edition. All over the book, it states that you can find code examples or downloads on the companion website and it gives the web address where you can find them, but they are not there. So the companion files (which you will want) were considerably harder to find on their website than I think they should have been.  I tried the ""contact us"" link on the website which sent an email that was returned as undeliverable. Way too disorganized for my liking. If a publisher decides to publish a book such as this and not include a CD-ROM, but instead put the files online, that's fine, but the files should be where you say they will be in the book. If you do purchase this book, you will want the companion files. I was able to find the companion files on their website at [...]",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition"
"I was a little hesitant to buy this book since some reviews pointed out that due to a publisher change the sample files were no longer available for download. I grabbed the Kindle sample anyway, though, and found that the author's website (the url of which is in the book) has the files. So while it may be slightly confusing to have the wrong url in the text of the book, the author's website (which is also printed right in the front of the book) does have the files you need. So this criticism of the book is not warranted.Anyway, as for the book itself, I'm about halfway through and have found it very useful. I was taking a beginner's class in Python before buying this book, but since the classes were only once per week I wanted to learn faster. As such, I'm able to compare how this book teaches the concepts of Python programming against how the teachers in my class present the same concepts. And while there's no substitute for personal, interactive instruction, I can say that I'm very impressed by the readability of this book and the way it teaches programming. The code samples are very useful for showing how Python works, and the writing style is very easy to follow. He uses good analogies to illustrate concepts, and in general I've made steady progress through the book and am retaining a lot of knowledge. The searchability of the Kindle version is especially helpful, since it's easy to skip back to previous concepts if you need a quick refresher.Anyway, I just wanted to share my thoughts on this book and let people know that the code samples are indeed available, though the url in the book is sadly incorrect. But again, just check the author's website and you can obtain them, which is highly recommended because they do make the learning much more interactive and hands-on.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition"
"Book did exactly what I needed.  I know other procedural languages, but not python.  I needed a book that would help me program in Python, what I was able to do in other languages.  However, I found after the fact that the website references in the book, that allows one to download the code examples, does not work.  When I finally did find the site, it required payment.I was able to type up the examples as written.One star removed for the inability to access the code from the website mentioned in the book and the fact that one has to pay for it.  I ended up buying 2 more books as I needed to learn dataframes (pandas and numpy)  and how to work with Excel files (openpyxl)",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition"
"I have tried many programming books. I have even taken a programming class or two but it has never really clicked before. There have always been to many jumps from explanation to assumed understanding. I would get lost and things never clicked. Recently I decided to give programming another chance because I believed somewhere in the back of my mind that I should be able to figure this out. I have been a system administrator for years but have never delved into scripting or programming before because I thought maybe I was just never meant to be a programmer. I decided maybe it was just the way I learn. So I decided first to start out with a HeadFirst book. It lost me immediately. The way it was presented in that book definitely didn't click for me. I set back to the task of finding a book and came across this one. This is it. I love the way he goes through the code and then has you run it and then explains what every line of code is doing. This approach has finally made things start making sense. I am even able to figure out the Challenges at the end of the chapter and I am loving it! Thank you Michael Dawson!On another note...I notice that people are having problems finding the files that go with the book. If you take the link recommended it the book and then go to downloads it is rather confusing, but if you go to the link recommended in the book and then do a search for python and then take the link for this book, another screen will come up that will give you an option to view available downloads. Harder than it needs to be admittedly, but that is how I found them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition"
"This was my third ""go"" at trying to grasp Python.  The first was via an online tutorial, the second was from a different book that I had borrowed.  I felt this book did a better job than the tutorial of teaching the fundamentals and was much better than the other text.  A big strength was the end of chapter questions and projects.  It forced me to really learn some concepts that I wouldn't otherwise have grasped.  I now have a better feel for Object Oriented Programming than I did before.  The book was also fun to read and the example programs were interesting and instructive.The big drawback to me was in the final chapters that used the livewires module.  I had a hard time getting that installed and working properly.  I also felt that the entire book went a little downhill in terms of instruction at that point with lots of instructions passed over rapidly with little explanation.  Perhaps it would have been better to simply learn to do what needs to be done in pygames rather than access pygames via livewires.I also feel still a little unprepared to tackle the big project I have in mind, so I'll look to continue my studies in some other way.  Perhaps an even better book would have left me feeling more confident and prepared for programming.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition"
"I am giving it 3 stars because the book goes through assuming everybody runs windows operating system. At the beginning of the book it explains how to install it on Linux and Mac, but after that it moves forward as though you are learning on a windows box. That would be all fine and dandy if there weren't syntax differences. Also in the book it says go to this url (printed in the book) for code downloads so you don't have to type them all out, but when you go there you are redirected to some school. No downloads to be had. Now maybe you can click on the ""contact us"" or try and contact the author and get the code. I don't know, but I didn't try.I am pretty irritated with it because I am using Linux, and I have to keep going on the net trying to find out why my code doesn't work only to find out that the syntax is completely different then is in this book for Linux. There aren't even any Linux/Mac hints. I have not tested this on a Mac, but I am assuming it is going to be the same issue.It is probably fine if you run Microsoft, but I didn't test it because I don't have any Microsoft laying around.If you are running Linux or Mac's figure that the code out of the book will not work and you will have to Google the proper syntax for your OS.I am giving it 3 stars because once the syntax errors are corrected, and the code finally works the book has good ideas for code.It probably is a 5 star if you have a Windows box, but if you have a windows box I question why you are programming in Python anyway. I would think VB or Power shell would do the same thing in Windows.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition"
"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner has a great premise: explain programming fundamentals and python language specifics with frequent ""games"" interspersed to show off new skills. The first six chapters follow the premise and include great explanations. They introduce basics like printing text and interpreting user-entered data and move on to arrays and functions. The games are simplistic but serve as great reinforcement or practice, and they come with challenges to ensure you really understand the concepts.However, beginning in chapter seven and continuing through the rest of the book, topics get increasingly complex while the explanations stay the same length. The code samples still work, but are increasingly difficult to follow, and the challenges appear more and more daunting. As other reviewers have mentioned, the book moves onto new topics without complete explanations of previous topics. After completing the book, you'll recognize objects and classes, graphical user interfaces, and basic games, but you won't feel confident enough in your skills to use any of this knowledge on your own unless you're supplementing this book with others.By the end of the book, you're ""reproducing"" a simple pizza-dropping game and a version of Asteroids, but most users will have no idea how to make their own game. Indeed, most beginners who start Python don't intend to use the language to build games! Rather than rushing to the games at the end of the book, I wish I could have spent more time really learning and understanding files and the principles of object-oriented programming; those skills would have set me up to continue learning about Python. However, if you'd like to have something to ""show"" at the end of the book, the games included are great to show off to friends!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition"
"Let me just say this first: the material in the book itself is worth 6 stars. It's second to none in its quality. This goes for all Murach books, 5 of which I own. The one reason however, that I've ranked this book and a few of their other books (made after their HTML5/CSS3 book) a 4 is that it seems like they've changed the thickness and quality of the paper the pages are printed on. I've noticed with the newer books that because the pages are thinner, if you like to take notes and highlight like myself, that everything tends to bleed through the pages and look bad. To be fair, I would rank this product a 4.8 if I could, removing a fifth of a star for this downside. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest learning languages from anything but a Murach book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Murach's Python Programming

It is true you need to keep coding to retain anything, but if the book provide specific code lines then explain it VERY vaguely (opposed to explain line-by-line) you will have a miserable time. It’s even worse for me where my entire class is based on this book and I’m spending $$$ on the class, this awful book when I’m learning more from YouTube.

Matthew shows you how to increase the performance of many different aspects of your Python programs like blocking I/O, non-blocking sockets and selectors, and how to make multiple web requests concurrently.

"I wanted very much to like this book, but I just can't...  When an author takes on the endevour of teaching the reader about something, they take on the responsibility to do so accurately. This is especially true on technical subject. Unfortunately, this book falls way short.At first I thought the author just wasn't a hardware guy. I've run into this in the past. My freshman year, I had a EE-Digital Design professor that didn't truly understand the analog the digital world is built on. He could quote the ""rules"" of EE-DD off the top of his head, but didn't know why they existed or how to tweak them to his use.  I thought this after reading things like saying that there's the hall effect sensor is ""nothing more than a simple switch"". Yes, you can purchase a Hall Effect SWITCH, but the author shows a phidgets 1108 Hall Effect SENSOR - an analog device. Even a simple look at the phidgets page for the part shows it is ""provides a voltage output that is proportional to the applied magnetic field."" So no, it is NOT ""nothing more than a simple switch"".  He also writes that he sees little use for such a device on a rover ""outside a certain  small niche of applications"". The most common use for the device is rotational speed encoding... like used when trying to keep 2 motors running at the same speed to make a rover go in a straight line. Maybe the author should have look at Make:Sensors on the subject which even mentions speed encoding and talks about how to read it as an analog device.Then a page later or so, he tells about pull up/down resistors. He fairly accurately describes their use and floating inputs, but then writes that we can ""do the same in code"". The code simply enables the hardware pull up/down resistors that's built into the RPi. There's no software that can fix a floating input.The next page we hit the use of a ""reed switch"" where how shows a micro-switch. A reed switch is a magnetic switch like those used in burgular alarm systems. Two or three reeds are in a glass capsule with inert gas that switches when in proximity to a magnet. Just in case I was just used to common terms, I searched and could find no reference to a microswitch being called a reed switch.Then I started looking at the code snippets included in the book. Basic generally accepted software constructs like using a constant for pin assignment aren't there.  So if we want to change a GPIO pin, we'd need to change it in every line of code that uses it. And if you mix multiple segments, suppose that the same pin for different sensors, we need to fix this BEFORE trying to incorporate it. This severely limits the reusability of the code.So while I wanted to like this book, I just couldn't. I couldn't even finish it. I'm actually a bit sorry I bought it. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but if you're teaching a technical subject, please research - at least the simple things, which this book doesn't.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Make a Raspberry Pi-Controlled Robot: Building a Rover with Python, Linux, Motors, and Sensors"

I found the topics in this book to be fascinating which is why I picked it up and was hopeful that a self taught developer would be able to find some use for this book. To which I have found some nuggets of helpful tips. It broke down bit shifting in a pretty digestible manner.However with all the above said I found the book very disorganized. For example in chapter one the purpose was on the discussion about small problems. We go straight into the fibonacci sequence (which did give some very helpful hints on recursion) but then right after talking about that we go straight into memoization without any segue. Then after that we go right into trivial compression then after 4 to 4 1/2 pages we go right into unbreakable encryption. With each change in topic I was left with trying to figure out what the author wanted me to gain and how did those specifically classify as small problems.I gave it a 3 because this book does have some very cool insights and taking the examples and making them my own has helped but for someone without a CS degree I was left wanting more depth and that is something that I didn't get.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Classic Computer Science Problems in Python

"I particularly like the way Professor Kopec organized the topics, code and explanations.  Although the book lacks complexity analysis, it is an excellent book for someone who is picking up Python and reviewing CS topics at the same time.  The topics selected by Professor Kopec aren't the same as those you would find in a (rather boring, I should say) data structure and algorithm book where C/Java code snippets are (sometimes in brute force) translated to Python code snippets.  The topics in this book build up a repertoire of re-usable frameworks for the ""basics"" such as search, CSP,  and graph algorithms as an illustration of how generic framework can be constructed in Python to solve classes of similar problems.  In later half of the book Professor Kopec leads the reader into the AI realm of things (at the introductory level) such as neural networks and game theory.  Very enjoyable read and great learning.

"I've either read or own nearly all the Bayesian textbooks on the market. They range in presentation from too simple to esoteric and mathematical without clear sense of their application. To date the stand out textbook on the market was McElreath's statistical rethinking... it hits the sweet spot of mathematically rigorous and well written, but hides some of the messier computational details behind a custom R package.What's great about this book is that it is so focused on conveying the essentials of how-to applied computation. The authors make the choice to demonstrate a range of increasingly complex models across two distinct probabilistic programming languages (pymc, tensorflow probability), which forces the reader to grapple with the applied difficulties of shape management and model specification. The  variation of presentation is aided by a free online book with clear code examples and beautiful visuals (generated with Arviz). I was initially sceptical of the choice to use multiple ppls but by presenting two implementation options the reader is forced to focus on what is core to Bayesian  computation rather than details of a specific APIA previous review called this an entry level text, but I'm not sure that does it justice. Some of the examples are of simple datasets but the book is pitched to teach you the mechanics and the whys and wherefores of a Bayesian workflow so you can apply them creatively on your data. I was particularly grateful for the clear discussion of Approximate Bayesian Computation and the Timeseries modelling. The emphasis and attitude to prior and posterior predictive checks for model calibration was well put throughout the text. Plus the code is in Python! This is a big plus for me as I've never worked anywhere where the production environment would tolerate R code...I highly recommend this book as it fills a niche in the market and is cluttered with the wisdom of practiced Bayesian modellers. Somewhat different in tone than the more academic offerings on the market, more focused and practical.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)
"I have purchased the textbook as an Amazon Kindle format on Amazon.CONS:- Amazon Kindle is making impossible to save a PDF copy of the book for Amazon's silly DRM policies. However, scientific textbooks would read better as PDFs instead of a Kindle format. Really disappointed how CRC Press (headed by Taylor & Francis press) has decided to rely on Amazon Kindle. For the record, Cambridge University Press is adopting the same DRM protected policy, unfortunately. DRM policies clearly are blocking scientific research. The choice of selling a DRM protected textbook sounds awkward since the first author (Osvaldo Martin) has published his previous textbook in 2016 (""Bayesian analysis with Python"") with Packt press. At Packt they are brave enough to offer DRM-free material. Why Mr Martin has changed his mind in his second textbook?- The formulas are poorly written (mathematically correct, but the style is bad). They need to be rewritten in LaTeX. Perhaps the hardcover version is better. I did not check it.PRO:- The textbook successfully delivers the promises of the first textbook from 2016: very intuitive explanations of complex statistical concepts; few mathematical formulas; lots of concrete examples; gorgeous plots;- it is worth mentioning the useful accompanying site (https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/) where you can find plenty of well written Python code about the plots and analyses presented in the book;CONCLUSION:In terms of ""entry level"" Bayesian modeling, I think this textbook (Martin et al. 2022, ""Bayesian Modeling and computation in python"") and McElreath's textbook (Richard McElreath 2020 ""Statistical rethinking"") are the best ones out there.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)

"First of all, I'm neither a novice nor an expert programmer.  I have successfully programmed in many languages over the course of my career as an electrical engineer.  Mostly however, I just learned enough to code up whatever was required to solve a specific problem.  This book is a good, from the ground up, organized approach to learning basic Python.  It won't make you an expert and I can't imagine it will make you employable, but it is a good start and will prepare you to move on.  I liked the programming chapters and to some extent I enjoyed the projects.  I found that the projects relied too much on just entering calls to add-in programs and didn't provide much insight into what was actually happening.  I successfully built the aliens game and that provided some insight into pygame and the use of python.  The data analysis project was very illustrative about the capabilities of using python and graphics addins.  The Django section however, was maddening.  It is possible that because I used PyCharm as my IDE but I was continually getting hung up on one trivial mis-step after another.  I suspect that the only way to get successfully through the project is to use the exact IDE, python version, and Django version that the author used.  At one point, for instance I was hung up for several days before I found that some particular Django call was known to not work in Python 3.7 and required 3.7.1.  So I upgraded to 3.8 and the latest version of Django then got hung up on something else that didn't work even though I resorted to just pasting in the code from the book ( this occurred in the logins section).  So I have now abandoned the book and will move on to something else.  Somewhat disappointing to get this far and find a case of diminishing returns.Overall, it is a good book and an achievement for the author.  It is clear that he has a lot of insight and has done a lot of work.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming"
"I have 20+ years of web programming and wanted to move into Python for hopefully another 20, and moving into apps, hardware, etc.  I have probably picked up five or more java, c++, etc books over the years, and found most like the dry turkey that ruined at least one Thanksgiving.This one was pretty breezy and easy to stick with.  Part of it could be Python itself, as I was doing just fine with the free lessons I found online.  It did a good job of moving on quickly from the ""hello world"" stage to topics that were educational and meaningful to someone with prior programming experience.  I came away from it feeling competent and energized to continue forward on my own, possibly finding an intermediate/advanced text and feeling pretty confident I would be ready for it now.I appreciated the scope as well.  I don't plan to program a game, and that part may have taken up more oxygen than the web portions I was more interested in.  That said, I see the practical use for it, as it was also a vehicle for making what may have been the dry points of providing the basics of programming and wrapping it in something fun and lofty to distract from that.  Having it end with Git tracking and taking it to production gave it a practical outside world usefulness.Cons:- Not a big con, but my edition straddles versions of Django, but there are sites with the corrections.  Can't be helped, but having to chase changes took me out of the pace occasionally.- Sometimes would breeze over ""now do this because this"" steps.  Not very often at all, but I did finish knowing I was going to have to figure out a few things on my own when I go from book to use.- Buy a bottle of rubber cement when ordering.

"As someone who has dabbled in many programming languages, I was looking more for a guided tour of the Python language than an intro to programming that happened to use Python, and Python Crash Course was just what I was looking for. I especially appreciated the section on code testing, which is almost never covered in beginner books and should be. The author has also taken the time to cover the two versions of Python you might find in the wild, and also provide instructions for Windows, Linux and Mac.I did have two issues, both of which were handled very well:First, there was one place where I copied the book's code exactly but kept getting a different result than the book said I should, and I could only get the expected result if I changed the code a bit. I ended up emailing the author about it, not really expecting a reply at all, but within a day I had a detailed response from him confirming that I had found a problem with that section, why it had happened, and that it would be fixed for future editions. Cool!Second, I ran into some characters in the Kindle version being shifted to the right, + and - most notably, which caused problems like += and -= turning into =+ and =-. I tried to compensate for it, but I got really stuck in the alien shooter section because of one that slipped through, which I only caught after bug hunting for an embarrassingly long time. After that I wrote to the publisher, who requested screenshots and also sent me a revised file with corrected formatting. Excellent customer service there.The only thing that really detracts from this book is the method of teaching is the more passive ""type all this code out and then we'll talk about what it does afterward"".

"I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I wanted to start fresh on a new language. For some reason, Python seemed very attractive and I made a commitment to learn it in 2016. After taking a few courses at Treehouse, I decided I would like a book, because there is something about text that feels more concrete than videos. This book stood out to me so I gave it a shot, and I am glad I did.The tone of this book is very easy going. It's moderately paced, so it feels like you are always learning something new, but not going too fast, and the book also never gets boring. It's very similar to other learning books, in that every new concept builds from the previous, etc...but Eric writes in such a way that there is no intimidation. Just a great style of writing.One of my favorite parts of this book is that every chapter has ""Try It Yourself"" sections that give you objectives based on what you've been learning about. I know other textbooks have similar offerings at the end of chapters, but these seem to blend in with the material so well, and they're nothing complicated. They're like friendly reinforcements to the concepts you just learned about, and a great jumpstart to get coding.Crash Course covers Python 3, and highlights the areas where Python 2 would be different. Eric also gives lessons on styling, and best practices, yet also says to just focus on getting things to work and go back later to make it more efficient, which I think is excellent advice and as I mentioned before, removes intimidation from anyone who might be worried they aren't up to par to code.I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an introduction to Python.

In the end, I feel confident enough to read Python code and write Python scripts to tie together library functions.

I realize that the title is a bit harsh but it’s genuinely how I feel about this book.  Maybe a few years ago the asyncio docs were bad but today in Nov/Dec 2022 they seem fine (even good).  This book is filled with really fluffy writing that goes on and on.  The “walk-through” chapter 3 is just a hodge podge of random thoughts and doesn’t seem to have any real objective.  Then there is a weird chapter that follows on third-party libs with a bunch of examples that are waaaaaay more complicated than the previous walk-through chapter.  The end … literally #facepalm,1.0 out of 5 stars,Using Asyncio in Python: Understanding Python's Asynchronous Programming Features
"Actually the book is only 100 pages long, all other pages are small examples with 3rd party libraries like aiohttp, sanic etc. Reading the book I found for myself only run_in_executor().

But the current price is too high for such small list of facts, which you can find in official asyncio docs.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Using Asyncio in Python: Understanding Python's Asynchronous Programming Features
"The book is basically a series of gripes about asyncio's documentation.It goes over a few terms and shows you a few recipes but you're left with an unmeasurably shallow understanding of the whys and hows of asyncio. The part of the book that explicitly covers asyncio is only 73 pages, the rest focuses on a random assortment libraries, most of which I'll never use.Here's the rub: I read it cover to cover and I still *BARELY* understand how asyncio works. The book needs to be scrapped and rewritten as a 750-page bible on Python async. As is, I spilled a whole cup of tea on it today and I didn't even bother to dab at the moisture. It's going in the trash.I'm mad. I'm mad at Python's infuriating incomplete/incomprehensible asyncio documentation and I'm doubly mad that this book offers only a surface tour of what should be a foundational part of the ecosystem.I've been a Python developer since 2008 and I was able to learn the threading and multiprocessing modules in a day.  I've been trying and failing to use asyncio in anything but the most trivial of apps for years. This feels like the *TEN (10)  YEAR* Python 3 migration all over again. There's no support for asyncio because no one wants to/is able/is willing/understands how to move forward. If Go had a larger ecosystem I'd have moved years ago.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Using Asyncio in Python: Understanding Python's Asynchronous Programming Features

"The first couple of chapters were very promising and quite entertaining while setting the scene for the material. Sadly it seemed to me that the promise of clear crisp explanations didn't last and by the time it came to convey how asyncio actually works and how one might use it the narrative had dissolved.I get that its not a simple subject and the implementation could have been more user friendly, but what I wanted and expected, for this price, was a best in class explanation and lessons. What I got, personally, was pretty tough to digest.

"This book goes very well with the free MITx courses available online.  The book covers the same material as the online lectures.  So you could do the online lectures without the book.  However, the book does go into a little more detail and is a more convenient medium for reviewing concepts than re-watching a lot of video.  The focus is not on learning syntax.  The focus is on learning how to break down problems and create solutions.  So it is ok for people who want to start learning Python.

"....That isn't an early Mel Brooks or Richard Lester movie! This film pretty much made me a fan of the Pythons, leading me to go see a retrospective of theirs including ""And Now For Something Completely Different"", ""Jabberwocky"" and ""Monty Python & The Holy Grail"". By far the most ingenious and well written thing they've done since and maybe SLIGHTLY funnier than ""Grail"", this movie makes fun of zealotry, hypocrisy, decadence, dumb luck and history, all in one fell swoop!The movie generally involves a case of mistaken identity that affects a Nazarene named Brian, born on the same day as, and right downstream from, you-know-who. This mistake affects Brian's life through the course of the entire movie, even after he joins a fanatic sect of Roman-hating terrorists. Though the Wise Men who mistook him for Jesus early in the film corrected themselves, Brian still has a hard time convincing the sheepish, desperate people who follow him everywhere that he isn't a messiah while trying to escape Roman capture.Cleese, Idle and Palin especially shine in this film, playing many disparate parts...Cleese as 1) A Roman centurion, 2) Reg, the leader of a terrorist faction Brian happens onto, and 3) A high priest/Pharisee/Sadducee - whatever, holding a zany trial for someone who has said the Lord's name in vain; Idle as: 1) Stan, a terrorist with gender identity problems, 2) A crazy but extremely lucky guy who never gets crucified though he's due for it, 3) A guy who taunts a fellow at the sermon on the mount by repeatedly calling him ""Bignose"", 4) A stuttering gravedigger, 5) A stoning rock, false beard and gourd vendor and 6) The guy who sings ""Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life"" to Brian while hanging from a cross; Palin plays: 1) Pontius Pilate, 2) a particularly zealous member of the terrorist band Brian joins, 2)A squirrelly beggar complaining about being cured, 3) a VERY mild-mannered head counter at Brian's crucifiction, 4) The guy Idle taunts at the sermon on the mount and 5) A verbose false prophet. Even Chapman, the one playing Brian, also plays the role of Biggus Dickus, the lisping friend of Pontius Pilate as well as the hapless ""Red Sea pedestrian"" himself. Terry Jones plays Brian's mother and an ascetic who has his vow of silence ruined by Brian stepping on his foot.When I first saw this movie, I didn't remember laughing so much since seeing Richard Lester's ""Help!"" and ""Hard Day's Night"" at the Circle In The Square up in Greenwich Village back in 1967. A true masterpiece of zany comedy as only the British seem able to do it.Wouldn't it be great to see either Rowan Atkinson's or ""Grant/Naylor's"" take on religion? The possibilities are endless!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Life Of Brian [DVD]
"I knew I had to see this movie immediately after watching The Meaning of Life, which unleashes three sketches of scathing (and did I mention hilarious?) satire at the expense of Catholicism and Protestantism.  On that note, I would like to point out that the comedy of Monty Python is so brilliantly funny NOT because its punchlines target God or the teachings of Jesus, but rather the innate flaws of the very Human institutions that mandate them.  To this end, anyone with faith who can recognize and identify with the very stupidity that separates humans from God in the first place should be able to laugh along WITH the Pythons.  Unfortunately, the controversy from some of the more sensitive religious reviewers posted on this site led me to believe that The Life of Brian would contain more of the same spot on satire as contained in The Meaning of Life.  Any religious satire contained in this movie, however, was subtle at best.  Though funny, even brilliant at parts, the humor of this movie is centered more around life in Biblical TIMES rather than actual Biblical EVENTS.  This fact also, strangely enough, leads me to assume that some of the people submitting reviews of this film ... like, i don't know, say the guy who thought he had the moral authority to declare that Graham Chapman's death from cancer was inflicted by God as a direct consequence for making this movie ... have never even seen it.  But I guess that this is the exact brand blind ignorance the movie is ultimately making fun of, isn't it?  So I guess the joke is on you.At any rate, although the movie gets even funnier with familiarity and offers its share of classic Python scenes (the Biggus Diccus, Haggling, and Stoning scenes all had me in stitches), I preffered both The Meaning of Life and The Holy Grail to The Life of Brian because of the greater variety of humor offered in the hodge-podge of shorter storylines.  But it's definitely worth watching ... and if you're a fan: the extras on the criterion collection make it worth owning. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.  And maybe if you're lucky, God won't even smite you if you chuckle here and there.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Life Of Brian [DVD]

"If you're considering buying this DVD (the Criterion Collection), chances  are you already know this movie, so I don't want to belabour the plot  points that others have done before me, except to echo that this is a great  (and funny) movie.  Instead, I will focus on the extras that the DVD  offers, so you can decide if you want to spend the extra money.There are  a plethora of extras, including a couple of commentaries (the commentary  with Cleese and Palin is superior to that of Jones, Gilliam, and Idle,  IMHO), some cut scenes, and even the radio ads.  The cut scenes even have  commentaries!  The scenes that were cut in the final edit probably deserve  to be cut, but for different reasons.  There is an opening scene with  shepherds that simply drags on and isn't particularly funny.  A bunch of  stuff cut from the kidnapping of Pilate's wife scene, which is a little  confusing and goes on too long, and the intro scene to the Suicide Squad  that appears at the end of the movie.  This scene is, for me, far more  offensive than anything that finally appeared in the movie (a Jewish-Nazi  resistance group, complete with a speech on the ethnic purity).  It is also  very funny, but you feel uncomfortable laughing at it.There are also  some British radio ads that are amusing, and a fairly in-depth featurette  on the making of the movie.  Some of the issues raised in the making-of  feature are repeated in the commentary(ies), but it's still  interesting.Thus, this DVD has it all for the Monty Python fan - the  movie itself, the commentaries and featurette that give the background on  the story and info on how and why scenes were shot, some nifty scenes cut  from the movie, and those radio ads.  Good value for the price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Life Of Brian [DVD]
"I first saw this movie ages ago, and through the years completely forgot about its existence. Then I watched the Monty Python documentary ""Almost the Truth"" and they talked about this movie and showed clips from it. That brought back the memories and I realized I must have this film for my collection.I'm not gonna go into great detail about the film itself. If you haven't seen it by now, I can't help you. Buy the damn Blu-Ray (or DVD if you prefer), and see it. It is absolutely amazing and is some of the finest work the Monty Python crew has ever done. I love absolutely every single second of this film, and if you don't, you are probably a bad person. I strongly believe that the people who don't like this movie are the reason we can't have nice things.On to the Blu-Ray then. I bought this particular edition because of the stellar reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. The picture and sound quality is great. The only complaint (if you want to call it that) that I have is the menu. The writing on the menu can be a little difficult to make out at first glance, but it's not really that big of a deal.I haven't checked out the commentary or any of the other special features because honestly I don't really care much about all that stuff. I bought the Blu-Ray for the movie, not for all the extra crap. Well worth the cash for the movie alone, all the special features notwithstanding. In the time it took you to read this review, you could've bought this movie. How can you live with yourself?",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Life Of Brian [DVD]
"Life of Brain is a little over the top, but for a Python movie it is along ways bellow the top. Terry Jones directs (with terry Gilliam as visual desinger) this movie about the alternate Jesus. Brain was born in the stable next to Jesus's (as explained in a hilarious oppening scence invlolving the three wise men) and goes on to become an accidental Messiah. Brain is played by Grahm, and the other Pythons make continual, skit like appearances. Life of Brian is more of a movie than any of the other Monty Python escapades, but it still doesn't flow as well as a normal movie.If I wanted to get a freind into Monty Python, this is what I'd show them, most of the humor is something everyone will appreciate, and everyone I know (besdes me) who likes Monty Python says that this is their favorite of the movies (I like Holy grail best).On the DVD: It has a theatrical trailer (only one, and it is basicilly just movie clips, nothing new added). It has a making of documentery (it gives nice, detailed opinions of the Pythons, by the Pythons as well as an informative look at the way Life of brian was made). It has 5 deleated scences. These are poor quality, but not overlly so. These scences all have a two of the Pythons talking (on an optional audio track). The final, special feature is four British Radio adds involving the Python's mothers telling you to go see the movie.  The chapters are well organized and placed. There are two derictor cuts, one with Eric Idle (my personal favorite), Terry Jones, and terry Gilliam. The other has John Cleese and Micheal Palin (Grahm died in 1989 from cancer). These cuts are quite nice, pleanty of info about the movie, and some of the personal feeling about the movie in general or specific scences.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Life Of Brian [DVD]
"""But I'm not the messiah! Go way!"" ...I swear I have laughed at MONTY PYTHONS stuff for years. The dry humor and Simi-slapstick is just endearingly hilarious. It seems I never get tired of it! And my son, (a very different generation indeed) finds this British wit hilarious as well, we wholeheartedly agree on this...one of the very rare things, believe that! It's clean fun. If a bit blasphemous, (ha ha). Review time:A man called Brian...not a very impressive name for, well, the supposed son of God. But Brian is just a young man trying to make the leap from adolescence to manhood and escape his mother's skirts (an ugly, but loving harlot played by Terry Jones) He unwittingly stumbles into circumstance after circumstance, that, - even though he tries to convince everyone he is just an ordinary guy- seems to thoroughly convince everyone that he is the second coming...a hero to save the masses, to brake the yoke of the Roman empire on the oppressed. The side busting antics are still bringing tears of laughter to my eyes and I've probably seen it, like, a hundred times! Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin, the core group of MP are all here and in their heyday. This IS comedy at it's best. And no gross outs, no farts,  no F bombs every other word...just plain Ol' brilliance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Life Of Brian [DVD]

"I’m a ""garage project"" type of programmer. I like to piddle and play with things that interest me, including automating my investment spreadsheets, programming my drone to recognize certain objects (thanks, PyImageSearch.com!), calculating how long it takes my Polaris pool vacuum to cover my pool’s surface, etc. So, this book was right up my alley.There are 12 chapters covering an eclectic collection of projects. Not all will appeal to everyone, but I found more than enough to keep me interested and busy. You can attempt to solve the problems on your own, or type-in or download the author’s code. The nice thing is that practically every line of code is addressed in the text, so if you encounter any new functions or commands, you don’t have to break off and search the internet. As an advanced beginner, I appreciated this, though it might come across as too much hand holding for intermediate or advanced users.The author assigns you a role in each chapter, like “NASA intern” or “Space Force tech,” to make the projects feel more relevant and interesting. They tend to have a fantastic feel, but at the core, they do address real-world problems, like applying Baye’s Rule, working with text data, scraping the web, manipulating images, decrypting ciphers, plotting charts, making maps from government data, and performing face detection and recognition.The book is very well written and provides interesting information besides the programming-related content. It also takes time to explain how methods like Bayes Rule, face detection, and face recognition work, which was cool. The basis for each is fairly straightforward but requires the blinding speed of modern computers to work.While the book walks you through installing third-party packages, it uses pip, rather than Anaconda. I took the author’s advice and set up a conda (virtual) environment for each chapter and used conda to install the packages. I guess the author didn’t want to force people to use Anaconda, but having a different environment for each project is the best course of action, and conda makes setting all this up really easy.One of the reviewers on the Amazon site says to Read this book and do the work. They’re right. This isn’t a learn-to-code-in-a-day book, it goes beyond the basic snippets. You can learn a lot of functions, packages, and techniques by sticking with it and patiently working through the chapters. I was really impressed with the Searching for Mars Landing Sites chapter. Never knew you could get so much info out of an image. Multiple chapters opened my mind to what you can do with Python. I highly recommend doing all the practice and challenge projects.

"Full Disclosure: I solicited Mr. Sweigart for an eBook copy of this book for review purposes. This was AFTER purchasing the original Hacking Secret Ciphers book for Python 2 around 3 years ago and AFTER purchasing a physical copy of Cracking Codes immediately upon release based solely on my love for the previous installment. If it makes you feel any better, he got me the eBook months ago, and I'm dreadfully late on my review.I'm a huge fan of Mr. Sweigart's work. I found Hacking Secret Ciphers to be a brilliant primer on basic Python programming practices, and find that it has only been refined and updated in Cracking Codes. Many friends have expressed an interest in what I do and asked me where to begin to learn programming concepts, and I frequently point them toward Python and Mr. Sweigart's resources.Cracking Codes walks you through several different methods of encoding messages with different ciphers using the Python programming language. From a simple Caesar cipher all the way through an implementation of the textbook RSA cipher. He walks you through from basic data types and decision structures through loops, data structures, common Python modules, and other advanced concepts. You read from and write to files, and learn to powerfully process and transform text with Python.I frequently use Hacking Secret Ciphers/Cracking Codes and Automate The Boring Stuff as references for writing basic Python programs. They're outstanding resources, and it's a joy to go back through Cracking Codes, retype all the exercises, and troubleshoot them until they run. The diff tool on Mr. Sweigart's InventWithPython site is a godsend, and the ability to run the source code to see what my code should look like when it executes has helped me pass many a roadblock.I don't quite understand how every cipher works or why it's difficult to hack, but I do generally get what each program is doing at any given point, and you can, too. If you don't quite get cryptography, this is also a neat way to look under the hood and get some of the basic concepts. It's pretty wild to see a computer hack a cipher in seconds that would take a human hours, days, or months -- if they could solve it at all.An excellent and entertaining book of exercises. I wholeheartedly suggest it, especially for teens and adults interested in computer science and programming. Thank you for another great book, Mr. Sweigart!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking Codes with Python: An Introduction to Building and Breaking Ciphers
"Cracking Codes with Python is a fantastic introduction to the Python programming language -- and coding in general -- using the super-fun theme of codebreaking. What's especially fun about this approach is that you can use these secret codes to send messages to your friends -- it's way better than invisible ink. As a student of computer history, I really appreciated the historical context provided for why codebreaking and ciphers are so important to the history of computers and technology. It's also great that the book provides a companion website with answers to all the practice problems at the end of each chapter, so that you can easily check your work.I've recommended this book to folks who want to learn to code, and I'll keep doing so! By the end of it, you'll become quite the code-breaker and also a great Python programmer! I hope you enjoy it!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking Codes with Python: An Introduction to Building and Breaking Ciphers

"As a Python tutorial, it is superb - comprehensive, well organized and painless.  Follow along with the exercises and you'll end up with a good working knowledge of the language.  Each succeeding chapter introduces more and more complex and useful language constructs, each of which is identified in the accompanying text and clearly explained.  Indeed, it is the use of constructs like lists and dictionaries that make Python the very valuable and powerful scripting tool that it is.As a Code Cracking tutorial, it is, as declared in the book sub-title, an ""Introduction"".  You'll see how various algorithmic strategies can be used against comparatively simple ciphers.  The techniques include frequency analysis, word pattern matching and dictionary tests for decrypted text.But the book is more about Learning Python than it is about Cracking Codes.  Upon completing it you'll emerge a journeyman Python programmer and a novice cryptographer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking Codes with Python: An Introduction to Building and Breaking Ciphers
"I like the book itself and teaching Python through cryptography is definitely a different approach to the subject that I found to be entertaining. You can also tell the author cares about the subject and moves through teaching Python via simple and historical ciphers up to the more modern. The book does not go into OOP, but there are plenty of materials that cover it so that is forgivable especially as this format is written to be more available to a wider audience. It doesn't require the dedication of getting through some much more thorough texts such as Learning Python.I was very happy with the ebook edition that I received from the author at my request in order to provide a review. I ended up purchasing the printed version since I tutor an introductory programming course and the examples would be relevant, but far enough away from what they would be working on for assignments.Big disappointment! The paper is so thin and the ghosting is horrible. I've never gotten a printed book from No Starch that felt so cheaply made. You can see the words on the back of the page very clearly! I've received other materials from them released more recently and they didn't have this problem.

"I haven't coded for 20 years and got this book as an intro to Python. It is written very well and presents the information in a way that is very useful -- it assumes you know very little and talks you through things. I'm about 1/4 of the way through and having fun trying out new ways of combining the few things I've learned so far. However, there are at least 3 mistakes in the first quarter of the book that could easily trip up those who are truly newcomers to programming, who might not immediately say ""Hey, that doesn't seem right...""On page 25 it talks about double or single quotes as a way to enclose a string. The examples provided show a double quote example but the other example lacks quotes altogether and would not work. The code snippet at the bottom of page 38 is just plain wrong, even allowing for another line alluded to in the prior paragraph but not written out. I see no way that the format function in that code snippet could possibly work, and had to try many other versions of what the code was trying to do in order to make it work as intended. And on page 39 they talk about using \ as an escape character in a string but in the text there is a point where they use a / instead, which does nothing. Also, amusingly, on page 3 is an invitation to ""Click below to get this free PDF guide"". Difficult to do in a bound book.So, a new edition with better editing is needed but with that caveat I do recommend this book.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Learn Python Quickly: A Complete Beginner’s Guide to Learning Python, Even If You’re New to Programming: Crash Course with Hands-On Project, Book 1"

It isn't a huge issue as that section is intended to be a discussion of some of the more as advnced, yet highly various concepts and I don't know if they would really got into any of the other chapters.

"As a longtime fan of Monty Python, I was thrilled to get my hands on the 4K Ultra HD version of ""The Meaning of Life"". And let me tell you, it did not disappoint.First of all, the picture quality is outstanding. The vibrant colors and crisp details bring the absurdity of Monty Python's humor to life in a way that I've never seen before. Every scene, from the gross-out ""Mr. Creosote"" sketch to the bizarre ""Every Sperm is Sacred"" musical number, looks like it was shot yesterday.But the real star of the show is, of course, the comedy. ""The Meaning of Life"" is a series of sketches that explore everything from birth to death, with plenty of detours along the way. There are moments of biting satire, ridiculous slapstick, and even some surprisingly touching moments.As always, the Python troupe is on top form. The late Graham Chapman is particularly memorable as the host of the ""Galaxy Song"" sequence, while John Cleese delivers one of the funniest speeches in the history of cinema as the pompous headmaster in the ""Live Organ Transplants"" sketch.Of course, this being Monty Python, the humor isn't for everyone. If you're easily offended or put off by crude jokes and irreverent humor, ""The Meaning of Life"" probably isn't for you. But if you're a fan of absurdist comedy and British humor, you owe it to yourself to check this out.Overall, I can't recommend ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" on 4K Ultra HD enough. Whether you're a die-hard Python fan or just looking for a good laugh, this is one movie that's sure to leave you in stitches.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's The Meaning of Life
"...a Python fan since about twelve, I vividly remember this film coming out when I was thirteen or so.  I loved it.  It's great that it has not only held up but, like fine wine, it has gotten better with age.  Maybe Terry Gilliam's right when he says, in one of the commentaries, that, today, comedy's standard is so low that ""our crap seems good no.""  But it reveals their genius in so many ways.  It reveals a confidence they clearly didn't feel--as tho' they'd gotten their sea legs--in the first two efforts.  Though ""Brian"" is their supreme achievement, I have to say that this film must be placed ahead of ""Holy Grail""--which given its budget looks distincly like badly shot TV.  Hysterically funny, but the budget limits are are even more glaring in a high res medium like DVD.In ""Meaning of Life"" the entire cast are masters of the medium (something Cleese proved independently in ""A Fish Called Wanda"") and they use their skills, rising even to lyrical heights (Eric Idle's paen to the universe in ""Live Organ Transplants"").  And the effects are more hysterical twenty years later.This movie is also remarkable for the rather bitter satire of American pop culture.  Heretofore, the Python's had stayed within the classic tradition of British comedy--filled with whimsy and just plain silliness and the class structure.  American humor is generally either observational or political--and these days it almost entirely the latter.  Even the masters of observation, Goldberg and Carlin, have abandoned it for bitter political diatribes attacking former fans like myself in the basest terms because out political beliefs differ.And it follows, as it should, that the movie's best skits are the ones true to their tradition.  George Harrison once called Python the continuation of the Beatles (to the point of chipping in $8M for distribution and advertising for ""Brian""!).  And, especially in the all too brief Gilliam animations, this is completely accurate.  Without being at all derivative, they capture the whimisical sensibility the Beatles had updated and transformed and ran with it.One draw back is the rather low-rent 5.1 remix.  I've other films--e.g. the Godfather films--which are older than have far better jobs.  So don't expect much.  In fact, you might even consider using the 2CH option as the remixing engineer makes little use of the rear speakers.That gentle bitch aside, the deleted scenes are mixed (why on Earth Jones thought anyone would want to see more of Mr. Creosote is beyond me?) and clearly wisely hit the cutting room floor (especially the horrendously unfunny Martin Luther skit), but some the commentary by Jones and Gilliam--clearly done at different times and mixed--is interesting most especially for the bitterness of Gilliam's attitude.  It has been so on the two preceding films, but it's much more intense on this one.The brief interview segments shows the group rivalry is still a hot issue in the guys' psyches, nearly twenty years after Graham Chapman's tragic death ended the group; they are still bickering.  Gilliam's comments about Cleese are particularly acid; Cleese does he usual job of insulting nearly everyone.  He is returned the favor by the rest of the group, tho' Jones slyly does it with the most class and thus does it the best.  Cleese, after all, easily slips into insufferable.  Hence his brilliance as Basil Fawlty.A reluctant four star due only to the ****-poor 5.1 remix.  The studio, surprise, surprise, didn't want to spend any extra money getting a good one.The movie itself: 5 stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's The Meaning of Life

"""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" is a classic comedy film from the iconic comedy troupe Monty Python. The film is a series of skits and musical numbers that satirize various aspects of life and society, such as religion, sex, and death. The film is divided into seven segments, each dealing with a different stage of life.The humor in the film is irreverent, absurd, and often tasteless, but it is also clever, witty and highly original. The film features some of Monty Python's most memorable sketches, such as the ""Fish slap dance"" and the ""Catholic schoolboys"" skit. The musical numbers are also noteworthy, including the catchy ""Every Sperm is Sacred"" and ""The Galaxy Song.""The Meaning of Life is a film that is not for everyone, as it is not afraid to push boundaries and tackle taboo subjects. But for fans of Monty Python and for those who enjoy offbeat and unconventional comedy, it is a must-see. It is a movie that will make you laugh, think and question the meaning of life in a hilarious and irreverent way.Overall, ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" is a classic comedy film that has stood the test of time.

"The film starts off strong and slowly decays and finishes of very sloppily. I think that was the intent of the pythons. This feature film in my opnion is probably the worst of the python films. There are scenes that you will never forget and some you wish you had never seen. Its tasteless and vulgar. Its sickening and sad. Its funny and its bad.Theres not much to say, if you dont like skit comedy or stage comedy then you wont like this.The film very effectivly goes into the ultimate futiliy of life and i think this would be a better title:"" Monty Pythons The Futility of Life."" its almost like the pythons condenced the book of eccleciasties from the Holy Bible.Now the bluray version is very clean and clear and safe to buy. there were no issues in the film with bad picture or sound. It all seems very well done. There are so many mindless features that any python fan would even consider too much. Much to much. I think thats the point. There is a commentary track for the lonely that reminds me of the pythons goofy cartoon sounds. Its funny in the context of watching the movie. Otherwise that commentary track makes absolutly no sense. Again i think thats the point. Ultimatly i think the pythons point of this film is to purposly waste your time to better understand the meaning of life. Im not being sarcastic i actually think its designed to waste your time.I would not recomend this film to anyone that has something better to do such as cleaning the house or shaving your face. the entertainment value is low. again i think the point is to piss you off that you wasted time and money. one of the pythons on the extra features is actually screaming about how much he hates this movie, and i think hes being serious. again this film is only for hard core python fans anyone else that is being introduced to the pythons would hate this film. if you want to introduce someone to the pythons start with the holy grail and follow up with life of brian. then ease them into the flying circus and then if they are hard core enough then they would like this. hahaha i think i understand this movie more after writing this. so i would give it 5 stars because i do hate it.""I really really hate this fiml!

"Eric Carle is one of our favorite authors! This is another wonderful illustrated books in his beautiful style (like the hungry caterpillar).The story is about a python that just keeps eating every animal he sees. The python wants to eat everything and is super greedy. Then he gets so big, he finally stops. The animals inside his belly kick, twist, trying to get out. The python feels sick and has to spit all the animals out.Instead of learning his lesson about being greedy in the act of greed he mistakes his tail for another animal and eats himself.My kids thought his book was hilarious. They laughed everytime the python ate more. Super cute book that has to be for 5 and up. I really don't think little children would understand the humor or the lesson.

It is a movie that will make you laugh, think and question the meaning of life in a hilarious and irreverent way.Overall, ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" is a classic comedy film that has stood the test of time. It's a perfect blend of absurdity, satire and wit that will leave you in stitches and questioning the meaning of life itself.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's The Meaning of Life [Blu-ray]

"The film starts off strong and slowly decays and finishes of very sloppily. I think that was the intent of the pythons. This feature film in my opnion is probably the worst of the python films. There are scenes that you will never forget and some you wish you had never seen. Its tasteless and vulgar. Its sickening and sad. Its funny and its bad.Theres not much to say, if you dont like skit comedy or stage comedy then you wont like this.The film very effectivly goes into the ultimate futiliy of life and i think this would be a better title:"" Monty Pythons The Futility of Life."" its almost like the pythons condenced the book of eccleciasties from the Holy Bible.Now the bluray version is very clean and clear and safe to buy. there were no issues in the film with bad picture or sound. It all seems very well done. There are so many mindless features that any python fan would even consider too much. Much to much. I think thats the point. There is a commentary track for the lonely that reminds me of the pythons goofy cartoon sounds. Its funny in the context of watching the movie. Otherwise that commentary track makes absolutly no sense. Again i think thats the point. Ultimatly i think the pythons point of this film is to purposly waste your time to better understand the meaning of life. Im not being sarcastic i actually think its designed to waste your time.I would not recomend this film to anyone that has something better to do such as cleaning the house or shaving your face. the entertainment value is low. again i think the point is to piss you off that you wasted time and money. one of the pythons on the extra features is actually screaming about how much he hates this movie, and i think hes being serious. again this film is only for hard core python fans anyone else that is being introduced to the pythons would hate this film. if you want to introduce someone to the pythons start with the holy grail and follow up with life of brian. then ease them into the flying circus and then if they are hard core enough then they would like this. hahaha i think i understand this movie more after writing this. so i would give it 5 stars because i do hate it.""I really really hate this fiml!

"I love that this exists. For anyone who is interested in Monty Python, it is a fantastic resource to be able to read the scripts. As a teenager, I had this book, and reading it often cracked me up.However, Monty Python was working in the early 1970s and some of their humor played on racial stereotypes in a way that now feels very out-dated. While watching the show, it was easy to overlook these racial stereotypes, because the show moved along so quickly.But, in print, some of the racial stuff becomes much more prominent. There is a bit in which a lawyer talks about how he was late, because he couldn't find a kosher restaurant. Again, these are not deal-breakers, as Monty Python at least tends to point their satire at all people. Still, for readers in 2015, this book's material does contain some jokes that don't quite land well anymore.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus; All the Words Volume One

"Okay. I'll admit it. I've watched every episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus several times. I have all the episodes on DVD as well. And I have significant parts various sketches memorized. But one thing I lack: The ability to understand a Britisher speaking with a British accent. So, when I was given ""All the Words"" as a Christmas present some years ago, I was at last able to figure out those parts that had remained a mystery to me. For example, for years I couldn't quite make out the third of the four chief weapons of the Spanish Inquisition. ""A ruthless efficiency"" sounded like ""the rule of sufficiency"" to me. I had no idea what the rule of sufficiency might be. Finally, I realized that there was no rule of sufficiency at all.And so it was that once I owned the two volumes of ""All the Words"" a new world opened up. I knew that the fellow who sold beds and who ""exaggerated a bit"" (every figure being ten times too high) was named Mr. Verity, a name I had never been able to quite discern no matter how closely I listened to the dialogue, and that Ronald Equatol's wife was named ""Audry.""

"It may seem odd that a book devoted entirely to recursion would contain such statements as “You never need to use recursion. No programming problem requires recursion … In fact, a recursive function might be an overcomplicated solution…” Nevertheless, Al Sweigert goes on to explain the ins and outs of a programming technique you should rarely, if ever, need to use. And he does so masterfully. Recursion and recursive functions seem to many (including me) to be esoteric mysteries, understandable only to those elite few who are wired to think in a pretty unconventional way. We are taught from a young age that you can’t define a word by using that word, itself. To that idea, recursion says “watch me!”. In explaining recursion, Sweigert is careful to begin by laying important groundwork. With adequately (but not overly) detailed and approachable explanations and examples, he discusses functions, their operation and features. He spends significant time explaining the call stack, what it does, how it is structured, and how it operates, leading to a discussion of ‘stack overflow’, one of the risks of using recursion. With that out of the way, he then devotes an entire chapter to comparing recursion and iteration, demonstrating that in the vast majority of cases, recursive functions simply aren’t necessary and in some cases perform worse than their iterative counterparts. The ensuing chapters look at recursion in action, exploring several popular recursive algorithms and techniques. It is in these chapters where we begin to see where recursion is actually a good idea, where it is a good fit (and also where it is not). So, while recursion may be mostly unnecessary, it is absolutely tailor-made for certain functions. Among other things, Sweigert explores traversing tree structures and demonstrates how memoization (yes, I spelled that correctly) can improve the efficiency of some recursive functions. He provides a plethora of examples demonstrating each concept he explores. It is worth noting here that Sweigert provides code examples in both Python and JavaScript (where possible), making it a valuable resource for students of both. The book ends with several projects that build on the lessons that come before, including one that implements the very cool Droste Effect. For the beginning and intermediate programmer, which is the only demographic to which I can relate, the real value of this book lies not only in its teaching about recursion. Its value also stems from its ability to stretch you just a little bit further, to make think just a little bit differently, to give you confidence that maybe lofty concepts that seem way above your head are within reach. Any book that can achieve that while simultaneously telling you that what you’re learning is mostly unnecessary is well worth the read.--Reviewer was provided a review copy by the author",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Recursive Book of Recursion: Ace the Coding Interview with Python and JavaScript
"I have yet to finish this book, but I have found the explanations in the first half to be very well-put and thorough.

"I encourage folks learning programming to first buy Al Sweigart’s book, “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”.  That book teaches you Python from the beginning and assumes no previous knowledge.  The book used in conjunction with his video course on Udemy, similarly named “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”, are a great way to start learning Python.His latest book, ""The Recursive Book of Recursion"", takes the reader into the more advanced subject of recursion.  Topics include the concepts of the stack, pushing in and popping out of the stack, and stack overflow.  Recursion is compared to iteration, and examples are shown where both approaches are shown and critiqued.  Cases where recursion is advantageous are presented with illustrations to enhance one’s comprehension. While not a beginner’s book, it is a good read to fill in a sufficiently complex subject. Copious Python and JavaScript recursion code are provided.  Some fun and cool demonstrations of recursion make use of turtle graphics.  Going forward, this will be my ‘go-to’ reference for recursion.  Thank you, Al Sweigart!Here’s a breakdown of what’s included (from the book):Introduction - Covers how to set up Python and JavaScript on your computer to follow along with the code examples in the rest of the book.Part 1: Understanding RecursionChapter 1: What is Recursion? - Explains recursion and how it is the natural result of the way programming languages implement functions and function calls.  This chapter also argues that recursion isn’t nearly the elegant, mystical concept many claim it is.Chapter 2: Recursion vs. Iteration – Dives into the differences (and many similarities) between recursive and iterative techniques.Chapter 3: Classic Recursion Algorithms – Covers famous recursive programs such as the Tower of Hanoi, the flood fill algorithm, and others.Chapter 4: Backtracking and Tree Traversal Algorithms – Discusses a problem for which recursion is particularly suited: traversing tree data structures, such as when solving mazes and navigating a directory.Chapter 5: Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms – Discusses how recursion is useful for splitting large problems into smaller subproblems and covers several common divide-and-conquer algorithms.Chapter 6: Permutations and Combinations – Covers recursive algorithms involving ordering and matching, as well as the common programming problems to which these techniques are applied.Chapter 7: Memoization and Dynamic Programming – Explains some simple tricks to improve code efficiency when applying recursion in the real world.Chapter 8: Tail Call Optimization – Covers tail call optimization, a common technique used to improve the performance of recursive algorithms, and how it works.Chapter 9: Drawing Fractals – Tours the intriguing art that can be programmatically produced by recursive algorithms. This chapter makes use of turtle graphics for generating its images.Part 2: ProjectsChapter 10: File Finder – Covers a project that searches through the files on your computer according to custom search parameters you provide.Chapter 11: Maze Generator – Covers a project that automatically generates mazes of any size using the recursive backtracker algorithm.Chapter 12: Sliding-Tile Solver – Covers a project that solves sliding-tile puzzles, also called 15-puzzles.Chapter 13: Fractal Art Maker – Explore a project that can produce custom fractal art of your own design.Chapter 14: Droste Maker – Explores a project that produces recursive, picture-in-picture images using the Pillow image-manipulation moduleFinally, I would also recommend another one of his earlier books, “Cracking Codes with Python”.  This is an excellent book on using Python to encrypt, decrypt, and cracking various encryption algorithms.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Recursive Book of Recursion: Ace the Coding Interview with Python and JavaScript
"Recursion is a complex topic to understand in the first place no matter which language we chose to pick to implement the concepts. In this book, Al starts with the intuition of what is recursion via multiple examples, and gradually moved towards defining many condepts like functions, stacks, call stack and so on. I loved the second chapter on Recursion vs Iteration which build a foundation on taking the decision on when to use recursion and when not to. I would strongly recommend to go over chapter 1 to chapter 3 even if you are well verged with recursion/DP, this 3 chapters has lot to offer for anyone who is new as well as for seasoned developer.The best chapter for me was on memorization and DP, I loved the vizual images used by Al on explaning few of recursive function calls.Its a must have book for any software engineer who is looking to build a very strong foundation on recursion and DP. And this book also can help to strengthen many general computer science concepts. I would highly recommend this book and would advice to code as you read the book and dont jump to the next chapter without practicing.Lastly, I just wish the publisher make a colored version of this book, I guess it would enhance the learning if we have the book in colored version (it really helps to reach the code snip-it and images)",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Recursive Book of Recursion: Ace the Coding Interview with Python and JavaScript
"Al Sweigart's ""Recursive Book of Recursion"" is a superb exploration of a traditionally intimidating topic.This is split into two halves- the learning half and the projects half. In the first half, Al breaks down the structure of a recursive function and a few of the practical ways they're used. He also walks the reader through classic recursive algorithms, like the Tower of Hanoi and a flood fill. I had fairly low expectations of this book going in, since I've been in industry for a while and, though familiar with recursion, don't use it much. But, this book helped me see recursion for what it really is: the right tool for specific sorts of jobs. Plus, this is the first ""bilingual"" programming book I've ever seen (Python + Javascript).Finally, the project section of the book was great. He starts with the full result, then walks through building it piece by piece. I was impressed with how easily complex programs could come together.

"Al Sweigart is a gifted programmer who has written several bestselling programming books that help novice programmers develop into burgeoning software engineers; The Recursive Book of Recursion is no exception to excellence.In this book, Sweigart demystifies the recursion algorithm in simple, easy terms that even a beginner will understand. This book includes tons of example code (in both Python and JavaScript), practice questions, and practice projects that will help reinforce concepts discussed in the book.Before reading this book, I was imitated with the recursion algorithm, and avoided using it. However, after reading this book I was able to design my own programs using the recursion algorithm to solve a few coding challenges.I found the projects in this book to be fun and engaging. I really enjoyed chapter 14, The Droste Effect, which is recursive art technique that generates a similar recursive image from any photograph or drawing utilizing images.

"Have you ever read a dry (pun intended), boring book on programming, but you waded through it hoping to glen information from it's depths? This is not that book.From the introduction to the last chapter it's well written and engaging. Recursion is not an easy topic to understand, let alone discuss in a way that keeps the readers attention and focus, this book manages to do just that. Al starts explaining what recursion is with multiple well thought out, but not overly complex examples, expounds upon that with examples of stacks, call stacks, and functions, etc. while giving the reader a solid foundation.  Then it becomes the question of to use or not to use recursion and the reasons for.I would highly recommend this, and all of Al's books and courses, you simply cannot go wrong.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Recursive Book of Recursion: Ace the Coding Interview with Python and JavaScript

"I've enjoyed Al's books in the past, and I'm so glad I checked this one out too. I appreciate the structure, the tone, and the examples in this book the most.So far, the book is compassionate in its approach to a subject that many learners find intimidating, and is quick to acknowledge when and, more importantly, WHY things might be confusing (e.g. it references ""The fact that the call stack doesn't exist in source code is the main reason recursion is so confusing to beginners: recursion relies on something the programmer can't even see!"") This type of explanation and acknowledgment help new learners feel at ease.This book also has great examples in the form of both code (JavaScript and Python) and diagrams/figures. First, the text describes what is happening in an example, then you get to see the code, and then often a diagram or table that visually demonstrates exactly what is happening in the example.I also appreciate the simplicity of some the examples in the first few Chapters. The book uses common examples (Fibonacci, factorial, exponents, palindromes...) that students likely have already seen (non-recursively) in previous exposures to educational programming content. As someone who doesn't actively think about recursion day-to-day, I appreciate these examples that I can easily wrap my head around.I also appreciate the ""Further Reading"" sections, which point readers to deeper or alternative sources covering the relevant material!All in all, this is another book from Al that I think people should check out if they want to dig deeper into recursion!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Recursive Book of Recursion: Ace the Coding Interview with Python and JavaScript

"Bought this book as an amazon ebook.  Currently working through the programming exercises.  It is relatively easy to follow and the examples are definitely interesting and fun.  Examples use mostly API python modules for coding.  It is always amazing how little code it can take to create a fully functional application using api components.  The web browser app surprised me and works quite well.  The writer certainly knows his stuff.  The example code can be downloaded to save time but I like to manually enter the code, since you learn by doing.  It also helps you understand error messages and how to fix typos, indent or syntax errors.  I tend to miss colon's and  have learned to watch more carefully when coding.  The only complaint would be that I found the book a little pricey considering it was an ebook.  I feel the publishers (not necessarily Amazon) are gouging the public by over pricing.

For example, it spends a good bit of time explaining basic programming concepts such as syntax and logical constructs. And for most of the chapters it describes what is happening in the code line-for-line.

"I'm not sure why this book got some bad reviews, because it will get you up and running with python. No, it won't make a programmer out of an absolute beginner, you need Chris Pine's 'Learn to Program' for that. But if you want a palatable and informative overview of Python, and how to work it, this book will do the trick.I got into Python because of the Raspberry Pi, but most Pi books treat Python in a pretty cursory manner. Yes, you'll be able to write ""hello world"" and put up a function or two, but if you really want to know what's under the hood you need more info. However, you don't need it served up in 1600 pages as one other introductory text attempts to do.Like most Dummy books, this one covers a pretty wide range of topics and does so in a fairly organized and presentable manner. Because there are so many headings (those 'clever' Dummy headings!!) you can flip and browse around in the book to your heart's content to get what you need. And the index, the bane of too many modern books, is a useful one.4/9/14- (An added note about the examples- they are very terse, sometimes only a line long, but if you look at the near-by text you can find the missing lines in other examples. You just need to stitch them together. ANother thing, sometimes important information is buried in a short, non-descript sentence that is easy to over look. If you are skimming, skim the text carefully!)The examples are short, apparently some folks don't like them, but I found they gave me the commands and syntax I needed in easy to find format. Personally I don't like the way the code is set off on grey blocks, it makes them easy to spot, but the reduced contrast and small type is hard on older eyes. It's a minor quibble, and its' a consistent style with Dummy books, part of their look.I was struggling with Python before I got this book, mainly from a lack of information. A couple hours with this book at the keyboard and the difference is night and day.

"It's really surprisingly difficult for someone who has been programming for a long time to write about programming at a level appropriate for real beginners. The first time I taught a class full of beginners, I tried to take things as slow as possible. Then I spent the next week covering the material from the first day even slower.So when I was asked in 2007 to recommend a book to get for the participants in the Introduction to Python, I looked at all the ones I could find, but they all either assumed too much existing knowledge or covered material that would just confuse a beginner. Often both. But then Michael Bernstein pointed me to ""Python for Dummies.""If you're looking to teach beginners, or you're a beginner yourself, ""Python for Dummies"" is by far the best option. There's a few sections that are strikingly inappropriate for a book at its level (new-style classes!?) but it's still much, much better than any of the other books on the market in this respect.Note that since this hasn't been updated since 2006 it doesn't cover the very latest Python...  but it's not super obsolete since Python forked into 2.x and 3.x.

In general, Python is a super high-level language that is very (very) easy to program and use. Python is vastly slower than C/C++ (exceptions exist). However, Python is vastly more powerful. For many projects, programmer productivity is much more important than CPU utilization. Hence, the extensive use of Python for all sorts of tasks.This book is a great start for learning Python. After a few hours reading this book, any programmer should have no trouble being productive in Python. The ""Dummies"" books don't get a lot of respect. However, they are very, very useful for anyone with a real need to learn Python (or anything else).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python For Dummies
"I agree with some of the reviewers here, it is definitely disappointing to see a bad seed among the good ""... for dummies"" series. I have previous experience with programming languages, although this is not my everyday task. I got interested in Python and wanted the book to guide me through the basics. After reading the first 7-8 chapters I started asking myself whether I missed something in the previous ones, as I lost track (and interest) in the book.I found the examples parsed in the chapters rather useless, and not practical. Since, I have found several useful on-line tutorials on [...] where the user is taken through the chapters in a gradual, progressive way. The examples and exercises in a beginner's book should be based on what is learned in the previous chapters, giving the reader the idea that what is learned is put in practice, thus easily assimilated.I don't recommend this book for a complete novice, as she/he will lose interest in Python programming very easily! This book has the advantage of presenting the main and most important features of the Python programming language, but it sues a more advanced audience.The low rating is indeed due to the non adequacy of the book for beginners and for not following the good standards of the ""...for dummies"" successful series.Sacha",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python For Dummies
"I found this book to be a good learning tool to learn Python having already had at least some experience with programming. The only problem I have with it is that because it was published in 2006, some of the material is dated and I found that I had to look up how some pieces of code have changed with the new versions of Python. Besides that, as long as you have at least some experience with Python then this book should benefit you.

The projects are helpful and I've learned a lot doing them.The projects later on in the book are focused on data structures and algorithms and there are more code samples in that section.You also build a small ORM in the course of the book.What this book is really about, is teaching the reader a way to approach larger projects in an organized and thoughtful manner, and to track their successes and failures and use that information to improve their process and become a better programmer.If you're competent with Python but you're not sure what the next step is, this book could be helpful to you. It's more about using Python as a tool to investigate your own process, how you think and approach problems, than it is about showing you specific Python techniques.

"That's not a book about Python, that's more about project development. I was not surprised to find similar template books for Ruby or C,  ""Learn Ruby/C the Hard Way"" by the same author. What about the specific ""Pythonic way"" every advanced Python programmer should learn about? Nothing here.It is extremely verbose, considering the whole book has just a few lines of actual code. It's also very pretentious, and you may get tired of that style ""with an attitude"": we're not all in high-school, and this guy is not our teacher.It's also basically for Linux, and if you're a Mac or Windows guy, not very useful. Most Python books are OS-independent.A full chapter is dedicated to writing SIMPLE SQL database statements. I agree any programmer should know something about this, but did you buy the book to waste your time on such simple use cases as those presented here?Finally, this looks more like a book of homework assignments, but for some pretty large projects (many of them). Do you really have time to practice on such large projects? Or are they really necessary, with such a huge waste of time, just to become more advanced in Python?

"Each section begins with a problem that the reader would have no chance of solving, or having any idea of how to go about it, then the various commands needed to solve it are introduced one by one. Finally, the solution is shown. However, for the person for whom all the commands are brand-new, how a person knows how to put them all together in order to solve the problem is not at all clear. ""I would never think of coming up with that solution.""At the end of each chapter, the reader is referred to a half dozen or so exercises. These are found online and consist of problems that are part of international competitions for students. Some are easily enough solvable, but some are not for people who are barely familiar with the required techniques. They are test questions, not practice questions. Even worse, you are suggested to submit your solutions to the online ""judge,"" which is very thorough. In other words, you may have a solution that works for all the standard cases you have in mind, but the judge tests it against other, non-standard cases, and you may find yourself with no way to see what you did wrong. If this makes you too frustrated, I'd suggest just finding your own solutions and not submitting them to the judge.People who have a knack for ""computational thinking"" may not run into the difficulties I did. I found it less discouraging to use a book with a more standard approach, that is, with exercises more geared to making you familiar with the techniques of the chapter rather than being challenged at every step of the way.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Learn to Code by Solving Problems: A Python Programming Primer
"Update: Geron's book is much longer than this one (856 pages vs 400) and almost two-thirds of Geron's is about deep learning. This review is comparing this book to the first third of Geron's book. This book only provides several pages on deep learning (neural nets), similar to the other models. I would suggest this book for a basic foundation and if you want to dig into the minutiae of deep learning read the last 430 pages of Geron.I read the Geron book ""Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn & TensorFlow"" before reading this book. This book provides a better start for several reasons. First, it is better organized. Second, the code implementations rely primarily on Python modules, instead of custom programming.Regarding the first, this book is set-up so that a reader can get an understanding of Machine Learning (ML) step-by-step from the bottom-up. For instance, supervised learning, feature engineering, and model evaluation all get separate chapters. The model evaluation chapter provides an entire section, as well as graphics, for understanding the roles of training, validation, and test data, which are probably the most important bedrock concepts in ML. In contrast to this, Geron throws you right into an entire ML pipeline in the second chapter. It's a mix of feature engineering, linear models, stochastic gradient descent, random forest models, cross-validation, grid search, and even object oriented programming for custom transformers! This might be useful for quickly understanding what ML is like in practice. If later sections of Geron then went step-by-step and elaborated on the second chapter, it would be great. Instead, for instance, the second chapter is randomly about binary classification for image data. You only get two paragraphs in the first chapter on cross-validation and validation sets, and a sentence or two later in the book. I had to go to Wikipedia to ensure that I understood it correctly and robustly. I wish I had read this book instead.Regarding the second, this book does not assume a heavy programming background. Most of the ML pipeline is taught through the Python module Scikit-Learn. This is useful because the programming does not distract from learning fundamentals of ML. In contrast, in the second chapter of Geron, there is object oriented programming code involving concepts like constructors and inheritance. For this book, the most sophisticated chapter at the end, which is on pipelines and which expertly explains why feature engineering should be performed during model evaluation, doesn't even go into this. Some reviews mention that the author uses an mglearn Python package that he wrote. It is true that when he uses functions from this package the code is concealed. Arguably, this prevents readers who aren't familiar with Python from getting distracted by code that is unrelated to machine learning (such as creating visualizations). At times I was curious about how some of the code was working in the background (it is all available on GitHub), but the book's job is not to cover all aspects of data analysis with Python (which would be a separate book).In summary Geron teaches more advanced topics interspersed with the basics without an entirely coherent organizational structure. This book has an intuitive structure that elaborates at length on core ML concepts. It doesn't overburden with code, but may leave computer scientists wanting a bit more.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists
"This is a great book, and I'd say it is even great for those that are not familiar with python (you just obviously won't be able to run the code). For anyone with some basic understanding of linear algebra/statistics, the authors are able to present to you all the important (and sometimes subtle but significant) details, without the usage of equations, and more importantly, how they all relate to one another.All the concepts mentioned here are heavily backed with well thought of and well presented figures, in such a way that again I'd suggest you don't even need python to understand. If you do know python, loading the data sets and reproducing the figures is just a few lines of easy to understand code away (with the exception of the mglearn library includes which does some ""plotting magic"" for you. However, I believe each of them were appropriate. You can ignore them and make the plots in your own way, or just print the variables, it just may not look as publication friendly).Normally, I hesitate purchasing books that claim they may explain algorithms without the need of equations, and I expect them rather to be cook books of lightly and disjointly explained techniques (like an encyclopedia). However, I do not think such is true of this book. The power of scikit-learn is demonstrated and the algorithms behind them explained intuitively, and are referred as to how they fit together and complement each other.As with any introductory read, a supplement is needed from time to time and the authors' reference to Elements of Statistical Learning is a useful one (equation heavy). There are points in the book where the author defers to elements of statistical learning. I found these points suitable since further explanation would be out of scope.I read this book on my free time while on vacation, and much of the time I didn't have access to a computer. The concepts were so well presented that it was just a nice leisurely read. When I finally had time to access a computer, I was able to try the techniques on my data sets with some browsing back and forth through the book again, but otherwise with little effort.Finally, since I myself am a researcher, I would recommend this book to any other researcher willing to start delving into the world of machine learning. Further reading will always be necessary, but this book will give you such a good intuitive understanding and overview of the subject matter that you'll know what to do to proceed next, and how to do it without running in circles. Even better, you'll likely already have applied it to your research!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists
"I started determined to go through all the code samples in this book.The book starts with only four sentences about the Jupyter notebook although is the main environment for the whole book. The first code sample shown starts on line two of a cell, and it was very strange there was no line one. I was wondering if there was some type of misprinting.The code as printed is broken on page 10 where there is a line with 'display(data_pandas)'. This line gave me an error that display was unrecognized. I thought maybe this was a built-in Jupyter function so I went online to search. Eventually, I had to go to the author's GitHub and ask about this problem where I was told that he simply forgot to include 'from IPython.display import display'. It was a surprising admission because he did not say there was a misprint or mistake, but simply that he forgot to do that. It is very obvious there were zero technical reviewers for this book, because they would have also noticed the broken code right away.On page 11 we are introduced to a library called 'mglearn' which is a utility function that authors say they wrote for the book. Strangely, this repository has 733 stars on GitHub so it is obvious the library is not just for the book. Then in chapter two the author has tons of calls to mglearn which take in multiple parameters. The parameters are never explained and you have to go to the author's GitHub to see what the code actually does. In the 2nd chapter multiple of these mglearn calls broke for me. One seemed to be a conflict with numpy, and another I never figured out. I went to look at dicussions on mglearn to discover it is still a work in progress and there were sections where somebody was notifying the author that something was broken, and the author replying that he would look at it soon.The second chapter has 120 cell entries for supervised learning techniques. Each cell has roughly 5-10 lines of code, so there are nearly 1000 lines of code for the second chapter and they are all tossed into one gigantic Jupyter notebook. Explanations are very weak often defaulting to a brief description followed by code and then more code. Function calls and parameters are rarely explained at all.The last chapter is about natural language processing which is the machine learning subject I am most familiar with. Terms are often introduced with zero effort to define them, and it is assumed you already know many of the concepts. TF-IDF barely had any explanation at all, except to show the forumla for it. You can find much better explanations online.For a book which is so heavy on code and light on explanations, it is unacceptable that the code is broken.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists

"There is no question that the ability to harness technology has become an essential skill in business today. It is also the case that Python has become one of the most widely adopted programming languages, largely due to its versatility in solving problems and its user-friendly accessibility. So, despite the many self-help texts the already exist in this area, there is always room for another, especially one that seeks to acclimate beginners to the field quickly and competently. That is exactly what Python for MBAs attempts to accomplish and, for the most part, it succeeds in doing just that.According to the authors, two business school faculty with considerable experience teaching the subject, the book is aimed at people who have never written computer code before, but feel the need to understand at least some part of this rapidly expanding area before the world passes them by altogether. In particular, the authors want to show readers how they can use Python to automate some of their daily tasks—such as financial record-keeping or responding to messages—as well as condensing large, unwieldly databases into more useable forms. To do this, they divide the writing into two distinct parts: Basic Python Skills and Dataset Management.As promised, the book really does start at the beginning with an explanation of how to download the Python program and set up a home computer to facilitate the best programming environment. That is followed in Part 1 by three fairly compact chapters in which the basics of the language itself are presented, including how variables are created and used, conditional (i.e., True or False) statements, data lists, simple loop structures, and basic functions. All of this information is quite well explained and nicely illustrated with several examples. In fact, readers are repeatedly encouraged to work through these exercises on their own to gain confidence in each of the skills. If there is a shortcoming in this part of the text it would be that it seemed a little too terse and limited in presenting Python’s many features, although the discussion may be just enough to accomplish the authors’ goals.In Part 2, the tone of the project changes considerably as the topic shifts from developing basic programming skills to learning to organize and manage large databases. The motivation for the entire second half of the book is the analysis of a case study the authors have written on Dig, a New York-based restaurant chain, and how the company used data analytics to improve its operations. Essentially, each of the five chapters in this part is devoted to acquainting the reader with various aspects of Pandas, which is a Python-compatible software library used for manipulating large data bases and performing statistical and graphical analysis on that information. Once again, the authors do an excellent job of explaining each new topic that arises and applying case-based problems as examples.Overall, I liked Python for MBAs and I think it will be a useful tool to introduce some essential material. However, I also found the book’s title to be a little misleading in that it promises to be more about developing Python programming skills than it actually delivers. In reality, the text is more centered on database management, with only as much Python knowledge as necessary to facilitate that aim; a title such as Managing Databases With Python might have been more appropriate. Also, the book may be difficult to use in a classroom setting because its exposition is so heavily tied to the authors’ embedded case study and it lacks the type of end-of-chapter problems and exercises found in traditional texts. Still, this is a worthy effort that should meet the needs of a sizeable audience of business professionals.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python for MBAs

"This book is excellent, but I can see why it got some skeptical reviews. Here's the quick version: it's amazing for what it is, maybe even perfect — but if it isn't for you it REALLY won't be for you.First, you should know that this is a very basic book. It assumes no programming knowledge -- and it doesn't try to teach deep computer science principles or what's going on under the hood.Second, after going through this book, you will still be a beginner in Python. That's not bad, but be aware that this is just a taster, not a comprehensive guide. And I mean not just really sophisticated concepts, but some things that are kind of basic to Python. I was surprised to see exceptions (""try"" and ""catch"") not covered, for example.And third, this book takes a particular teaching approach, with a little intro text but where the learning is intended to be in the doing, with understanding coming from following the progression of challenges.If you're already familiar with programming but new to Python, try The Quick Python Book instead. (It's excellent!). That's also a good choice if you're an intermediate Python programmer looking for the next level. (But if THIS book is all you've got under your belt, it might be a bit much still.)If you want something that really explains as it goes on, with questions being ""knowledge checks"" at the end of chapters, this definitely isn't for you.But, if you're new to programming, and interested in learning on your own, and get impatient with a lot of theory, this is the right book to start.You don't need to take my word for it! My high-school-age daughter has been vaguely interested in learning to code for a while, but I've never found a good way to teach her. Trying to share with ad-hoc lessons wasn't working (too much ""yes, there's a great way to do what you are suggesting but I need to introduce five new concepts!"" from me!). Other books were either too much text or too many assumptions -- or just at the wrong level.This one, though — I gave it to her and two days later she's halfway done, proudly showing me her results, and asking good questions. Clearly, this clicked.I just wish there were several more follow-up volumes covering the next steps!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python by Example: Learning to Program in 150 Challenges
"Although I have many years of programming experience, I find that the easiest way to learn a new computer language is by looking at samples of code.  This book does not go into the more complex features of Python, but it gives enough examples to get me, at least, going.

"... because its value is not just because it's a guide with beautiful (COLOR!) illustrations and extremely helpful python code.  Much of its value is allowing users to get the most out of models that leverage geospatial data at all.Let me give a silly example that illustrates the point.

That's helpful- but most people don't even know that FIPS codes exist, let alone that they are the system that the U.S. Census uses to identify geography.The book separates out FIPS vs. other types of codes, but goes beyond that.  It actually breaks out not just the meaning of the code, but explains the hierarchy:- Nation- Region- Division- State- County- Census tract- Block group- BlockThat hierarchy for organizing addresses is stunningly useful for modeling any kind of human behavior modeling, including response models, fraud models, etc.  The hierarchy itself helps organize thinking and modeling approaches.Also in the book:- Exploratory spatial data analysis- Geospatial cases studies (I love case studies!)- Package reviewsPlease enjoy!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Applied Geospatial Data Science with Python: Take control of implementing, analyzing, and visualizing Geospatial and Spatial data with Geopandas and more"

"Having had this book for about 3 months now, and read most of it, I would say we have had a bit of a 'love - hate' relationship.  The positive points for me are:- The book gathers a great deal of information on 3 major MicroPython hardware platforms in one place - that alone might be sufficient reason to buy it.-  The book is project-oriented, which is often a very good way to learn a subject.  The projects are clearly explained for the most part-  There is a good level of technical depth in that the author often attempts to provide background information and explanations, as opposed to just presenting a project solution.  There are also many code examples that are instructive.My 'problems' with the book are:- The back cover says: ""Program your own .. projects with ease -- no prior programming experience necessary"".  This is marketing nonsense.- The author's writing style is a bit tedious at times.  He has a habit of ending each minor section of the book with ""next I will discuss ..."", and  includes an introduction and summary for each chapter.  Unfortunately, these intros and summaries do not contain any useful information, but just a rehash of what he covered in the chapter.- The book sometimes reads as though a class lecture was recorded and then transcribed and edited into a book.  There are too many ""I's"" and off-handed comments.-  There are places where some readers might well want more information, but the author decides he won't go any further, notably the discussion on WiPy wi-fi modes where he decides not to discuss Direct mode because ""the station and access point ... are all that I need to illustrate networking..."" and the discussion of the basic theory of GPS where he states: ""you need a fourth [GPS] beacon ... I am not going to go through the whole process again as I think you have it figured out by now"".  How would you know?-  In his (laudable) attempt to provide additional interesting information, he sometimes gets it wrong. In the discussion about GPS clock accuracy he introduces and tries to explain time dilation and Special Relativity.  He says that a space traveler moving at the speed of light would make a roundtrip  to Alpha Centauri in about 10 years, while his 'twin' back on earth would age 50 years!  That's just incorrect.  The roundtrip at light speed takes 10 years on earth, but the astronaut experiences a slowing of clocks (and a foreshortening of distance) such that he perceives the trip as taking only 2-3 years (depending on how close to the speed of light he travels).I could go on with other examples.  Many of these problems (especially the writing and stylistic ones) could have been avoided by a more rigorous editing process, so it's unfortunate that they were allowed to pass.One other note (which the author readily acknowledges, to his credit):  these hardware and software platforms are evolving rapidly, and some of the information in the book is already dated and incorrect.  For example, I spent several hours trying to connect to a WiPy as an Access Point, only to discover (after a significant loss of hair), that Pycom had changed the WPA key and the WiPy's IP address!  So it pays to check out these things yourself.So, I'm really somewhere between a 3 and 4 on this book, but with all the information and examples included, and coverage of three hardware platforms all in one place, I give an extra 0.5 for effort!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Microcontrollers: Getting Started with MicroPython

"Python for Microcontrollers is a small book about running Python on various microcontroller boards. Many hackers will be particularly interested in running Micropython on the ESP8266 because of how cheap various ESP8266 modules are. Sadly, this book's content is not impressive.The most important thing about this book is that it DOES NOT cover the Python language and is NOT a hand-holding tutorial (So much for the ""Getting Started"" in the title).Unfortunately this book has a number of flaws/omissions:- In Chapter 6 there is a section titled ""Playing MP3 Files"" but the code doesn't actually play MP3s, but short (less than 2 seconds!) .WAV files. Where did the ""MP3"" title come from?- The ESP8266 modules covered are NOT the popular and easily available NodeMCU or Wemos D1 Mini modules but the Adafruit Huzzah (which is more expensive than the above modules) and also the bare ESP-12E module. Working with the above modules is much easier than the bare ESP-12E so I'm not sure why this was selected.- In the ESP8266 section (Chapter 9) the author wastes some space talking about the 2.4GHz antenna trace length calculation on the ESP-12E and proving that the antenna is indeed a 2.4GHz antenna. This serves no useful purpose as users really don't care about the antenna once they can program the thing to do what they want.- Chapter 9 mentions that MQTT is a work in progress and there is no coverage but umqtt modules are now built-in to Micropython. MQTT is a very popular and easily implemented communications protocol but you wouldn't find any info in this book.- The mention of WebREPL for the 8266 doesn't make it clear that the benefit is that you are no longer restricted by communicating via USB. The instructions are also out of date (you need to do 'import webrepl_cfg' via USB terminal and setup a password so that you have some security). The book does not have information about the WebREPL password.- ESP8266: doesn't mention I/O sink/source current limits (and voltage levels) for I/O pins. How are you supposed to interface devices (such as driving LEDs) without this data?In a sense the problem with this book is the technical content is out of date - the book was written in Fall 2016 and covers v1.8.2, but the current version at the time of this review is v1.9.2. Not all of the book's problems are the fault of the author, as technical books tend to become irrelevant extremely quickly (especially for evolving projects like Micropython).The other thing about this book is that it is covering too many different boards in such a small book - the Pyboard, ESP8266, and WiPy. I would have settled for only Pyboard and expanded ESP8266 coverage using NodeMCU and Wemos D1 Mini/Pro modules (and ESP32 when it becomes mature)SUMMARY: I would suggest browsing online resources instead of this book if you are not an absolute beginner. If you don't know Python you will have to do this anyway since this does not teach the language. This book attempts to straddle electronics, python, and micropython topics but there is much missing from the book.

"I found this book a bit of a disappointment. In the advertising it says ""Learn MicroPython and object-oriented programming basics""  and ""Program Your Own MicroPython projects with ease―no prior programming experience necessary! "" So I assumed it would be a stand alone book allowing me to program one of those MicroPython boards. But in actuality....The author starts off with describing object -orientation.  This covered about four pages and the only reason I understood it was I already have some OO exposure. So I would not agree that this is describing the basics.  The book then moves to a MicroPython example but there is hardly any explanation of what the code means. Since I do not know Python I thought this book would help with that, but i was wrong  - it didn't.Now having said all that I do think the book will be useful for programming  one of the Python microcontrollers  But in my opinion to get best usage out of this book you should already be familiar with OO concepts and Python.Would I still have bought it If i knew all of this in advance? - Yes but only after I had got some more experience with Python",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Microcontrollers: Getting Started with MicroPython

"In her one-page ""How to Use this Book"" introduction, Foster states that ""this book will teach you the basics of Python programming"", and ""it's going to teach you how to think like a coder!"" The material is broken down into the following ten chapters, followed by half a dozen pages comprising debugging tips, a glossary, and a list of suggested web resources: (1) ""Welcome to Programming!"", (2) ""Python: The Basics"", (3) ""Variables"", (4) ""Data Types"", (5) ""Data Structures"", (6) ""Conditionals"", (7) ""Loops"", (8) ""Functions"", (9) ""Turtle Module"", and (10) ""Game On: Putting it All Together"". The author's presentation is organized well, introducing topics which build upon each other along the way, and the illustrations at the beginning of each chapter are colorful, catering to pre-teen children interested in programming fundamentals. Unfortunately, there are also many issues along the way. While I initially made an effort to ignore these issues, I started taking notes after finding myself losing track. Children working through this book, and those guiding them, will likely not notice these issues unless acquainted with programming themselves, in which case they also will likely not be in the target market for this book.Foster comments at the outset in chapter 1 that ""a program is a bunch of code designed to solve a human problem"". While she follows this statement with a decent conceptual explanation of programs, which have goals carried out by a sequence of step-by-step instructions, as a longtime developer and architect I know that many programs are definitely not about human problems: many programs simply do not have end user humans in mind. The author also tackles some tricky words (e.g. for ""algorithm"" and ""compile"") at much too early a stage, and it would have likely been better to leave these out of her presentation.Discussing integrated development environments (IDEs) in chapter 2 is also arguably covered much too soon, because this topic doesn't teach the basics of Python programming, nor does it teach how to think like a coder, the two primary goals laid out in the introduction. For the pre-teen beginner, it makes sense to initially use what is provided out-of-the-box when downloading and installing Python for the first time, rather than getting too sidetracked on available options. I'm in agreement with the author's two primary goals. Understand the basic programming process first, and then use your experiences to help guide you.During the author's explanation of variables in chapter 3, the f-string is introduced. Essentially, f-strings are a way to format strings, and the author demonstrates how to use these to keep track of variable values by printing them during program execution. Interestingly, however, the ""How to Install Python"" section in chapter 2 specifically comments about all the different Python releases currently made available, going so far as to state that the specific release used by the reader to execute the code presented in this book doesn't matter as long as you ""make sure the first number after the word  'Python' is a 3"". Not so: the f-string was not introduced until Python 3.6, so if a prior 3.x release of Python is used, this functionality simply won't work.In chapter 3, during the presentation on the order in which Python math operations are carried out, the author mentions that the BEDMAS acronym can help figure this out, that ""B"" stands for ""brackets"", and that brackets are evaluated first. But the example used during this discussion is ""n = ( 3 + 2 ) * 4"". So where are the brackets in this example? In revisiting the text which led to this discussion, I saw that in a sidebar 15 pages earlier a distinction was made between ""round brackets"" and ""square brackets"". In my many years of professional experience, I've never heard anyone refer to parentheses (i.e. ""parens"") as ""round brackets""!The ""Alien Socks"" example just three pages later that uses the equation ""num_socks = num_martians * martian_legs / 2"" doesn't make use of any parentheses. In this case, it doesn't technically matter how the math operations are grouped, but it's advised for new programmers to get in the habit of making code more readable, in this case making use of the equation ""num_socks = num_martians * ( martians_legs / 2 )"" because the emphasis is on pairs of legs in the story problem. Perhaps not coincidentally, the final calculated value in this story problem is an integer, but new programmers should understand the difference between floating point and decimal numeric data types, and the subsequent two-page discussion on numbers in chapter 4 doesn't discuss this topic.While I didn't come across any book examples that are wrong, per se, some are likely to be awkward or confusing. For example, in chapter 6, during the discussion of ""if-elif-else"" statements, three variables are presented: ""is_winter"", ""is_fall"", and ""is_summer"". While I appreciate the variable naming convention that makes use of an ""is"" prefix to indicate a boolean data type, why isn't ""is_spring"" defined? One can argue that the program example assumes possibility of the Spring season, and indeed the explanation for this example mentions all four seasons, and that the season of Spring is assumed if not Summer, Fall, or Winter, but what's this? The branching logic only explicitly checks for Winter and Fall, and if not Winter or Fall, Summer is assumed. A perfect example of a bug for chapter 2.Another confusing example is ""Find the Buried Treasure"" in chapter 7. The story problem leading up to the code that is presented states that buried treasure can be found in a beach that a crew of pirates has separated into 100 sections assigned the numbers ""1"" to ""100"". However, the code permits values of ""0"" to ""100"" as guesses. Why? Neither the story problem nor the code provides an explanation. While I've made some guesses as to why a value of ""0"" can be guessed, it would have been helpful for the author to either explain why this is the case, or simply remove the ability to choose ""0"" as a guess.This book periodically makes use of built-in Python functions, but only haphazardly makes use of these in the code that is presented. I found it surprising, for example, that in the ""Anagram Checker"" example of chapter 8 neither the functions ""upper()"" or ""lower()"" are used. The code is simple, comparing two string variable values to each other to determine whether both are comprised of the same letters. At the end of this example, the author states that ""to a computer, uppercase and lowercase matter a lot"", so ""keep this in mind when comparing anagrams!"" A perfect time to introduce these two functions!While chapters 9 and 10 introduce some important concepts, and are likely intended to provide some fun, I personally think these chapters should either have been left out or reworked to provide more substance. In reading through the book to this point, I noticed that objects had not yet been introduced, and unfortunately, the beginning of chapter 9 provides full disclosure: ""this book won't show you how to define your own objects"". Likewise, the ""Spaceships and Aliens"" game in chapter 10 might be entertaining, but players choose 4 digits (i.e. single integers), but these are stored as strings that aren't evaluated by the code to ensure that integer values are chosen. Another perfect example of a bug for chapter 2.This book is the third introductory programming book that I've reviewed in recent months, joining ""Tanmay Teaches Julia for Beginners: A Springboard to Machine Learning for All Ages"", and ""Coding Concepts for Kids"". Of these three, I view ""Coding Concepts for Kids"" as the best, but it doesn't teach a programming language, instead opting to teach how to think like a coder. Interestingly, this is the second stated goal of ""Python Programming for Beginners"", but it is very simplistic, targeted at younger readers. The book reviewed here is a good attempt, but in my opinion doesn't meet either of its two goals.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Python Programming for Beginners: A Kid's Guide to Coding Fundamentals
"This was a great book. I am genuinely impressed.  I am just learning python and this really helped.  I can now move on to more advanced books and have a mental reference.  It doesn’t go that far into OOP, but that’s ok.  Half of the battle of a programming language is learning syntax and she covers that.

"Python Programming for Beginners: A Kid's Guide to Coding Fundamentals has a target audience of ages 10-14, but I would definitely recommend it for adults new to coding as well. The author has a good way of connecting to her readers, by explaining rather than ""talking down"".  The explanations on how to think through what needs to be in the code, how to identify any potential problems, and how to fix bugs that inevitably pop up are especially good. The author teaches how to get set up with Python and explains what certain types of code do, how to write them, and how to use the information to write a simple game.Additionally, there are two more advanced projects, along with some suggestions of coding to try independently.  I am definitely well beyond the target audience age group, but I was surprised as to how much I both learned and enjoyed Python Programming for Beginners.  This book will absolutely serve as inspiration to many, especially those who love computers and want to learn more than just the basics.Disclaimer: I was given an Advanced Reader's Copy of Python Programming for Beginners: A Kid's Guide to Coding Fundamentals by the publisher.  The choice to review this book was my own.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Programming for Beginners: A Kid's Guide to Coding Fundamentals
"This is a very basic introduction to Python and computer programming in general. It is marketed as a ""kids guide"" but would be equally appropriate for adults. The sequence of chapters provides the basic building blocks of Python programming. It starts with basic computer programming concepts, proceeds to explain how to install Python, and then provides instructions about some of the basic functions in Python. After completing the book the reader will only be able to create the most rudimentary programs. If more advanced program skills are desired, additional books or courses will be necessary. The text is well written and the examples are clear and function as expected. The author does not use illustrations or diagrams much. At the beginning of the book, the author uses screenshots showing the programming code on the left and the output on the right. This format was quite useful.  Unfortunately it was not continued throughout the rest of the book.I recommend this book. It is not perfect, but it is much better than others that I have looked at. Several are much too simple, while others were poorly written and confusing for people without a programming background. This book balances simplicity with usefulness for the beginner.For those who already know another programming language, this book will not go into enough depth nor will it proceed quickly enough to meet their needs.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Programming for Beginners: A Kid's Guide to Coding Fundamentals
"I picked up this book along with ""Scratch Programming for Beginners"".  Both were published by the same publisher and look very similar in design.  I thought they were intended for the same audience, too.  Boy, I was wrong.  This book is so much more challenging than the Scratch book.  Not that it's not for beginners.  I think Python as a programming language is more sophisticated than Scratch, therefore you would need to be a more advanced learner in programming in order to understand and follow this book.  I should have read the description more carefully before rushing to get both books.  That said, I think this book is arranged neatly and would be a good textbook/reference book when my kid is ready.  We had a good experience with the Scratch book so I still have high hopes for this one.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Programming for Beginners: A Kid's Guide to Coding Fundamentals
"""Python Programming for Beginners"" teaches the process of coding, specifically how to code in Python. It's targeted at ages 10 through 14 and it's explained clearly enough that it should be understandable to that age range, but it's also useful for adults who want to learn the basic concepts of coding. The author did a good job of showing how to think through what needs to be in the code and how to identify the problem and fix bugs that happen in the code. She taught how to get set up with Python and explained what a certain type (variables, data types, loops, etc.) of code does, how to write it so that it will work, and then showed step-by-step how to use it by coding a simple animation or game. She then walked you through two more projects, each involving progressively more advanced coding, as well as suggested some changes that the reader might try by themselves. By the end, I felt like I finally understood the basics of coding and that I could use Python to create from scratch, not just copy and modify the game code in the book. Overall, I'd highly recommend this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Programming for Beginners: A Kid's Guide to Coding Fundamentals
"I received a copy of this book directly from the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.Python Programming For Beginners by Patricia Foster is an excellent introduction to Python programming for children ages 10 to 14, and even adults, like me, who sometimes need things dumbed down a bit for them. I found the book to be well-written and easy to follow. It did a good job of explaining the sometimes complex inner workings of coding into really simple concepts by relating them to things kids already understand, like ice cream, kittens, and jellybeans.Although perhaps not as thorough as I'd like, as an adult looking into a new programming language, I think for young children/teens, this is a good resource for teaching them to think like a programmer and get them started in making their own programs and games.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Programming for Beginners: A Kid's Guide to Coding Fundamentals
"Even though this is written for kids 10 and older, this book is actually great for adults too. My 10-year-old took the python class over the summer and it was very difficult for her to understand because the fundamentals were not explained. The teacher was using an adult book so it was hard to follow.This book is a big contrast because it breaks it down into fundamental parts that is easy to understand. The book's difficulty level for a 10-year-old is still really high so I had to guide my daughter along. I didn't mind because I was learning Python at the same time as her. I'm not really good at programming so I was glad to have this book to explain things in the easy to understand manner.My daughter thinks Python is fun but will probably not become a programmer as a career.

This book is written for kids, but it includes the whole guide to python programming. I like and applaud the fact that the author is writing a book for kids on how to use computers in an effective manner, not just playing games. This book is a real computer book and will cover things like loops as well as functions.  The only way you can tell it is written for kids is because the author uses concepts that are appropriate for kids to explain the programming steps.

"While the preface states that this book is ""for beginners whohave learned the basic of Python, but haven't written much beyondsimple scripts"" this book conveys a difficult progression forbeginners to follow.Specifically, beginners attempting to follow the initial GUI demoof Tkinter widgets starting on page 10 must follow an explanationof many widgets to page 21 before anything can be displayed.Ideally a beginner should receive feedback for each widgetdiscussed in this introduction to widgets.  Please add thenecessary 'pack()' or 'grid()' calls following each widget. Thenadd the 'root.mainloop()' to run the widgets so far.This would allow beginners to verify each widget works explained.Beginners would also be more inclined to play with the code andthus cement their learnings.The next widget would then be inserted before 'root.mainloop()'.Variables do not follow pep 8 naming conventions.  Using'myentry' without the recommended underscore only adds frictionfor a beginner to use variables: ""Is that name 'myentry' or'my_entry'?"" Please use pep8 checkers on your code!An unfortunate impact of tkinter not following pep8 should notimpact developers using proper pep8 suggestions. (Tkinterexisted before pep 8.)Following the unnecessarily obscure Chapter 1 using Tkinterwidgets, Chapter 3 switches to Ttk widgets.  The beginner hasreceived only the surface of Tkinter widgets and must now slogthrough a similarly muddled tour of Ttk widgets.Chapter 3 finally provides the first step in implementing thedata entry application. Yet once again readers are forced toenter 13 pages of code and visually test without a UI to verifycorrect entry.Yes, the code for all this has been provided. Readers desiring tounderstand the code will likely want to see results as soon aspossible. Entering the code manually and seeing immediate resultsprovides a great deal of learning.This book places unit testing after many pages of coding.Unfortunately, many other books relegate unit testing as anafterthought.A reader's code may display properly, but what side effects doomthe application to failure? Unit testing should follow each codesegment. Otherwise how can a beginner absolutely know the codeperforms correctly? Code coverage seems to be omitted.The use of mocks for Tkinter is to be commended.

"TKinter has been around for a long time, it has many of the GUI objects that everyone is familiar with (buttons, entry boxes, windows, etc).

"Python has become the most popular programming language in the world, in part because it can be used in so many different ways, is fully open source and free, and has tremendous support from a vast community of developers.This book is a great resource for developing simple user-facing applications in Python (""GUIs""). The Tkinter library, which is part of standard Python, is shown by author Alan Moore to enable development of simple to complex applications that could be used for your personal automation tasks to fairly sophisticated business needs. Moore explains the benefits of Tkinter over more ""modern"" approaches:Tkinter is in the standard libraryTkinter is stableTkinter is only a GUI toolkitTkinter is simple and no-nonsenseReinforcing this view, he allows you to create a ""Hello World"" application on your machine in the first 10 pages of Chapter 1.  From there, a great value of this book is that instead of just reviewing Tkinter, Moore shows how to use important integrations such as SQL for databases, how to access files, how to communicate with websites and APIs, and many other real-world use cases that, by the end of the book, can allow you to standout in your work or wherever you apply it.Because of the ""start simple"" and ""add layers"" style of the book, although it comprises over 600 pages, you can get going right away, and skip to features you want to use and come back to others later.  If you have wanted to develop ""real"" applications using Python, this is an excellent resource.  At the end of the book Moore shows how to ""freeze"" applications into executables that can be shared with others.

"I bought this for my 8 year old son. Now I do software development myself, so I was able to go through it with him. This book is not bad. I don't have others to compare it with, but there were a few areas I think it could be better. I missed it, or there was no chapter on reading input. I would have expected that to be one of the first things. A program is input + process + output. And this book never touched on input. I think of a good ""first game"" programming is computer picks a random number and you have to try to guess it. That requires input. The first few chapters are just fancy ways of printing out variables.Second main issue is I feel like it spends a lot of time talking about the pedantics of the various ways to make strings and printing them, and I feel like too much focus was spent there.Third is that I feel like the content is not as ""interesting"" as it should be for an 8 year old. I feel it got a little too academic and not really relating content to things in the real-world or things 8 year old kids would care about.I would hesitate to give this book to an 8 year old if a grownup was not going to follow along with them or already knows some programming basics. Maybe an older kid will be able to follow it more independently. That said, the actual programming/technical content is well within the grasp of my 8 year old.

"I give Coding for Kinds Python by Adrienne Tacke a score of two because of its practice of introducing advanced computer jargon early on with limited or no explanations.  Ms. Tacke uses computer jargon without realizing that many terms that seem common knowledge to her are not common knowledge to her target audience, kids.I have worked as a middle school teacher, professional tutor, and created and ran an after school program where I taught fifth through twelfth grade students to be tutors to younger children.  A key lesson I taught them is that any event that breaks a student’s understanding of what is being studied gets in the way of learning, and undefined terms are the prime culprits for students at all ages.I had hoped to use this book to teach my grandson (William) Python over a Zoom connection.  We each have copy of the book, and I expected that I could get him started and help him in those places where he could not advance independently.  However as I read this book I found 16 items within the first 35 pages that I felt I needed to explain to him.  On page 33, “string literals” were introduced without a clear explanation of what they were.  The term Literal is not even in the book’s glossary.  I searched online for a good explanation, but wasn’t satisfied.  I finally found one in the 1537 page O’Reilly book Learning Python by Mark Lutz.Based on my incomplete understanding of literals, I would explain them to William as a small list of data categories, such as words or numbers, build into the software along with the appropriate operators, stored in a quick access place by the software.  Strings that have not been pre-labeled as literals require the software to determine the data type and store the data in a different place.  The general advantage of using literals is that the program runs faster with literals than non-literals.We are going to switch over to Python for Kids, a Playful Introduction to Programming by Jason Briggs.

"Tired of seeing your kids playing Minecraft all day or watching endless Five Nights at Freddies videos on YouTube. I was. Now I sit down with our 9 year old and teach him programming (when I have the time). Does he enjoy it as much as Season 12 of Pokemon Sun & Moon? Probably not. But he does enjoy some of the exercises and is learning the basics of a skill that he'll be able to use in the future. I know some basic programming ideas and have coded HTML and CSS for many years, so I feel comfortable guiding him through the chapters (even though I know nothing about Python). I don't think kids will push through this book on their own, but it gives you a good opportunity to pull them away from their computers and sit them back down in front of their computers -- to do something useful.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Coding for Kids: Python: Learn to Code with 50 Awesome Games and Activities
"This book was written in clear language that kids can understand. My 11 year old was able to take the book and run with it. The chapters are organized logically and hit on the major building blocks of coding (lists, loops, if/then, etc). Note that we started using Python and this book on a Chromebook (with Linux OS also installed), but then switched to a Windows PC because there are modules some of the exercises import (like a turtle) that wouldn’t work on the Chromebook or Linux. I highly recommend this book for kids to start coding. And Python coders are in demand, so it’s a great skill to learn. Now we are looking for the next book to build on…",5.0 out of 5 stars,Coding for Kids: Python: Learn to Code with 50 Awesome Games and Activities
"This book was used by my 2nd grader, and he mostly enjoyed it. There were not parent/child struggles. The book is well written.1) Chapters are simple and approachable with some help from knowledgeable parent/tutor/teacher. The content is not boring either. They do not go on and on about syntax and its variations.2) The activities are also simple for enthusiastic kids or teens. More challenging activities are clearly marked. The exercises require problem solving. However, they do not require any knowledge of computer algorithms.3) This book does a good job of showing how to program in Python. It's mostly focused on syntax and not algorithms which is great. Doing both at the same time may be challenging for any child.If your child has expressed interest in coding, then this is a great introductory (sort of) book. If not, I would  recommend starting with Scratch and simple programming toys as first introduction to programming/coding.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Coding for Kids: Python: Learn to Code with 50 Awesome Games and Activities

"I am a software developer with 40+ years experience and have worked with many different languages and environments over the years.  A new project I started working required that I use Python which I knew very little about.  I bought this book thinking that the quickest way to learn Python would be to get a concise reference and look up things I needed to know.  This has worked for me in the past in other situations.Unfortunately, this book is not what I needed.  It is not complete enough for me to learn Python little by little.  Here are some of the deficiencies I found:-  I wanted to know how to format text with parameter substitution.  Looked for ""{"" or ""}"" in the index, but they were not there.-  I saw the ""pass"" command in one of the examples and wanted to find out what it did.  It is not listed in the index, and I could not find a description of it by thumbing through the book.-  I wanted to read about the string ""replace"" function.  It is not referenced in the index.-  I wanted to find out how to determine the length of a list.  Nothing discussed about this in the section on lists.Perhaps when I learn more about Python this skimpy reference book will become useful, but for a Python beginner, I fond it sorely lacking.  After hitting a wall several times, I decided to shelve this book and get a more complete one.(By the way, I don't think Mark Lutz is a bad author.  The book I bought to replace this one was ""Learning Python"" by Mark Lutz.  It has been really good so far, although at 1600 pages, it is probably more than I need.)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python Pocket Reference: Python In Your Pocket (Pocket Reference (O'Reilly))

"I'm learning Python but I already program in a few languages, so I wasn't sure I needed the big ""Intro to this Language in great Detail!"" book. I ordered this one instead and it's become my constant companion on my Python journey. It's exactly what I wanted when I need to look up the syntax or function I know exists but don't know exactly how to format in this new language. I'm learning python to play with the Raspberry Pi, not for any professional reasons, so YMMV.I can't rave about this pocket reference enough. It's the greatest. I've been through quite a few, even other O'Reilly pocket references, and while they've all been helpful to some extent, I was never able to teach myself an entire language from a pocket reference. I don't think that's a thing that would work if you've never programmed before, but if you're already a programmer and you've just decided to add Python to your repertoire, skip the big book and stick this one in your desk drawer instead.  Between it and google you'll be fine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Pocket Reference: Python In Your Pocket (Pocket Reference (O'Reilly))
"I refer to this frequently as I am learning Python and it usually gives me the answer but sometimes it takes quite a bit of searching and flipping back and forth. So I think the index and/or organization could be a little better. Some examples:* If you are trying to look up a concept but you don't know Python's word for it, alternate words likely won't get you there.* Suppose you want to copy an object, or assign the contents of one object to another, and you're trying to find the Python way to do that. The index does not have entries for ""copy"" or ""contents"". It does have an entry for ""assignment statement"" but that will just assign an object's reference to another variable so now you have two variables pointing to the same object. What you're looking for is under ""slicing"" but how would you find that unless you already knew it?A few more details / examples wouldn't hurt either although I understand they are trying to keep a ""pocket"" reference small.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Pocket Reference: Python In Your Pocket (Pocket Reference (O'Reilly))

"El libro se divide en 4 partes:1. Una breve introducción a la programación, a python y a su historia, para después pasar a lo practico, comenzando con la instalación de python y software.2. Esta parte es más extensa, se ven los aspectos más básicos hasta los más complejos; clases nativas y los operadores, estructuras y la sintaxis del lenguaje. Se ve como crear y usar tus propias funciones, objetos y módulos.3. Se ven aspectos avanzados del lenguaje mediante módulos de la biblioteca estándar; funciones matemáticas avanzadas o expresiones regulares a clases de datos dataclasses.

Lo que note es que menciona el libro que se complicaría un poco para personas que no tienen ningún conocimiento sobre este tema y siendo sincero si se complicaría pero solo si no tienes conocimientos previos de matemáticas ya que es necesario para ciertas funciones necesarias dependiendo de que quieras programar (solo si programaras algo muy complicado relacionado con cálculo o física).Le doy 5 estrellas por estar muy completo y llenar mis espectativas y ofrecerme aún más!Recomiendo al 100%",5.0 out of 5 stars,El lenguaje de programación Python de principio a fin (Spanish Edition)

"I want to be fair both to the author and the buying public. First let’s get the cons out of the way. I paid the hefty price because I know that many professionals who are not into publishing think twice before embarking on this journey. Some would tell you that the returns usually fall short. Well, the fact that the book is accompanied by a dvd is yet no excuse for the asking price. However, the author has taking great caution not to infringe copyright problems that he goes out of his way to design playing cards for the card examples. I was suspect of the price versus the 338 pages. How much can one cover in such modest space. I incorrectly assumed that I was going to get a workout with Pygame.Bear in mind that pygame has been ignored and no hope for a real working manual because the game realm has moved away from 2 dimension. To conclude the cons while there are some programming gems, the book is geared more towards the higher levels of game design.James Parker here presents something more like a master class on game design. If you’re not well versed in python and know little of pygame, then this book is not for you. I am a student of python and pygame and and realize that this is a for certain future study, right now I am in the pains of learning. Often times we welcome a book into our libraries knowing full well that we are not ready at this time but nevertheless see the advantage of owning such book because we know the time will come.Again: if you’re tinkering with pygame, keep learning and having fun but you will need more experience and knowledge before this book will make sense to you. Had I been on the advisory board of this publication I would have expanded the edition to begin with a thorough hands on working of pygame with many examples of the different aspects of game structure, even if you had another party cover the main pygame elements. Yes, we are talking going over 600 or 700 more pages. Again, you are getting good advise and ideas from the current edition simply because they are coming from a well versed professional in the game industry.

"Michael Dawson's text was required for a course I took.  Overall the book was useful, as the explanations are clear and there are plenty of code examples and problems that exercise the concepts.  However, the book will annoy those have previous programming experience, as it assumes no knowledge of any other language and explains what for-next, while, et cetera are.  I find the elementary approach surprising given that the author has another text on Python that appears more geared towards beginners.What really annoys me, though, is that Chapters 11 and 12 about games are essentially unusable.  The code examples in Chapters 11 and 12 are based on an author-modified version of the LiveWires package that is included with the book.  That's fine except that the mods are based on an obsolete version of LiveWires, and there appears to be no download site with a newer version of the author's package.  That means that in order to learn useful information from Chapters 11 and 12, the student must commit indefinitely to an obsolete version of LiveWires!  The lack of a download site is unacceptable and infuriating in this day and age.  Chapters 11 and 12 might as well not be included with the book, which is ridiculous as so much of Python development is game-related.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Guide to Programming with Python

"I teach a sophomore-level introduction to computer programming class using this textbook at a major university.  I reviewed many alternatives and while there are other books that may be a little bit better from a theoretical computer science perspective, I decided in favor of this book partly because it provided a much more gradual ramp up than most programming textbooks and especially because it couched everything in terms of games, which hopefully keeps things just that little bit more fun and interesting for the students.  Even the traditional ""Hello World!"" program is replaced by a ""Game Over!"" program, and the author is that dedicated to the premise of keeping it game-oriented and entertaining throughout.  And along the way you really do learn quite a bit about programming, both procedural and object-oriented.  I can highly recommend this for budding programmers.One note of caution, on two different fronts...  As another reviewer has observed, there is another book by the same author, called ""Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner"", that has almost exactly the same contents as this one, and is much cheaper.  If you are considering buying this book for your own personal use, the other reviewer's suggestion to purchase that book instead and save yourself some money is spot on.  HOWEVER, if you are making this purchase to satisfy a textbook requirement for a university course, that other book probably will not do.  Unfortunately, there are some differences in the end-of-chapter ""projects"" that will more than likely be used by your professor as class assignments, and if you get the other book you won't have the right assignments to work on and turn in.  So if this is to be your textbook for a college class, you probably have to purchase this more expensive edition.  At least Amazon offers this at a substantially lower price than most college bookstores.Note to other educators:  The reason I rated the book with 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are quite a number of errors in the supplemental teaching materials.  I've found something like a dozen incorrect answers in the generated quizzes, and the author's edited version of LiveWires has a bug in its games.py module that causes a crash if you use a Sprite object's lower() method.  (The second argument to Screen's _lower() method should be ""it"", not ""object"".)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Guide to Programming with Python

"Most programming books seem pretty drab, in that they teach by laying out the fundamentals, and rely on the reader to see how everything fits together. This book is nice because it takes the approach of starting with a practical need (in this case, game programming), and showing how to evolve toward an understanding of a programming language (in this case, Python) through the development of small games. Time will tell how well this method works in the big scheme of things, but I found it to be a nice alternative introduction to programming. It also has review questions and projects and the end of the chapters to further enhance the teaching value of the book.

"Authors:  Harry J.W. Percival, Bob GregoryPublisher:  O'ReillyPublication Date:  3/5/2020Disclaimer: I am reviewing my own copy of this book because I want to.  The publisher did not provide me with a copy. I promise to be 100% honest in how I feel about this book, both the good and the less so.About the BookThis is an introductory software engineering book that gives you more hand-on experience than your typical software engineering course.  The authors discuss domain-driven design, test-driven development, the basic concepts of object-oriented programming, and general software architecture.  It's broken up into two parts:  Building an Architecture to Support Domain Modeling and Event-Driven Architecture, with a bit extra thrown in at the end to fill in some gaps.  This is an unofficial follow up to one author's previous book, Test-Driven Design in Python.The first half, on building the architecture, gives you a high level view of your software and about setting it up for success.  It starts with an introduction to domain modelling, discusses basic architecture patterns, and gives examples of the Flask API.  It finishes with setting up your tests and being ready to add the meat to the bones.  The second half, on event-driven architecture, looks at event handling and the message bus that serves of the backbone of your application.Who is This For and Why Was it Written?In the preface, the authors claim that you are an experienced Python developer who has developed applications with at least a moderate amount of complexity, You have realized how difficult this can be, but you don't know much if anything about Domain Driven Design or basic architecture patterns.I would expand this to a slightly wider audience.  If you're an advanced undergraduate who has spent their university career working in Python and were not satisfied with your Software Engineering course, this book is for you.  If you are about to create your own open source project with even the slightest bit of complexity, this book is for you.  If you want to work on or take over an abandoned open source project, this book is for you.  There are other people this is for, but I'll end the list here.I would argue that this book fills a gap left by a LOT of software engineering books.  First, it gives you a hands-on experience, so long as you follow the code.  Second, is discusses patterns that I never learned in my software engineering course.  Third, it gives a good introduction to microservices, which are common right now.OrganizationThe first part of the book begins as soon as the introduction ends.  Half way through the book, they leave the architecture and look at the code running within that architecture.  Then it finishes with a series of appendices that fill in missing bits, expand on important topics, or give alternatives to how the main parts of the book handled this topic.  One example is how to use Django rather than Flask to achieve the same results.Within a chapter, there are a page or two that gives you a high level view of the upcoming text.  Each chapter comes in at 15-25 pages of clear written prose.  Then they finish up with a Wrap-Up (Summary) section where they review what you just read while also giving you a taste of what is to come.Did This Book Succeed?I think that this book does very well.  As someone who wants to write their own large program without knowing where to start (like so many of us), I picked up this book at just the right time.  It's not going to teach you all of software engineering (which they did not claim to do), nor is it going to teach you Python.  This is an intermediate level book who want to expand their developer's toolbox.  t was well organized, well written, and very much needed, as one of the few books of its kind.Rating and Final ThoughtsThis is a great book, which earns a 5 out of 5.  It's the book I need the most right now, as it will let me step up with my Python development.  I very much hope that the authors consider collaborating again for a design pattern book for Python.  I would expect it to be as well organized and written.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven Microservices"
"If you're a python developer, I suggest you read this book after a DDD book, O'Reilly also has a book called ""learning DDD"" and it's great to start with learning DDD.This book gives you examples of how to implement DDD in Python and it's just great to see it since we don't have as many resources. Love the TDD parts as well. Definitely not a beginner 's book, but perfect for an intermediate/advanced developer who's worked on an rest API service or two",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven Microservices"

"Many python developers may start with a simple idea in mind: python is easy to learn and use. They are right. Compare to many older programming languages, python allows you a quick start to build something useful. However, that also means that a lot of python developers can be less trained on those important programming principles. I have seen many people using python as quick and dirty ways to develop product in a professional environment because they don't know better. I have done similar things too. This book provides a concrete example to guide you on the path to develop a well designed product.  In contrast to some programming book, in which high level concept is introduced, this book does it from bottom up. It starts with common design mistakes and correct them through the chapters.This is not a book for python starters. If you haven't had the need to design a product or a python module, or you haven't had the basic understanding of python, you may find this book difficult. In that case, you might want to start with Fluent Python.That been said, if you are a python developer and are asking yourself ""what do I do to design a good product"", I would strongely recommend this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven Microservices"
"As a self-learner, I have read a lot of python books and have learned a ton from them. This book may not only greatly improve the way I write python, but I think it will transform the department I work for and other teams that use python.This book covers topics that aren't touched by most python books, and is an excellent resource to help you develop any python program, especially one that needs to get or save data from a database, interact with HTTP requests, or abstract business procedures.The reason I gave this book so many stars is not only for the topics that needed covering, but also the way they talk about them. The authors discuss the trade offs of the approaches they bring up, which is not done enough in the programming world.The book is easy to read, they have great exercises you can do on your own to pick up the concepts, and you will become a better programmer after absorbing the ideas in this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven Microservices"

Half the time I’m wondering why I’m wasting my time reading about details which are unimportant, and the other half I’m re-reading parts because it was unclear.

"Designing software has never been a deterministic field. Meaning, when creating an app, there's no one way to do things. Change is always inevitable. That's where the book comes in. It gives a sense of ""determinism"" to designing large-scale apps. But this book contains one flaw - not related to the content itself - but to the presentation/printing.

"I actually tried getting through this book once before, when it was first released. But I wasn't experienced enough with the supporting frameworks, like SqlAlchemy, for this material to really hit home. Fast forward a couple years, with another Python application on my plate, it seemed like there weren't any newer books which looked at project architecture specifically in Python through a DDD/TDD lens. (You might want to check out Giordani's Clean Architectures in Python although its not as extensive as this book.) So I gave Harry and Bob another look.  And wow!  This is really a comprehensive gem.Most design decisions are presented as the better of some number of alternatives, and they discuss each in a very easy-to-understand (and somewhat humorous) manner. So if your project doesn't exactly mirror theirs, there's still a lot of worthwhile takeaways from the book.Some minor criticism... they change the project a lot, i mean A LOT throughout the book. I get that its supposed to mimic how you might refactor as you develop, and there's a git repo with code broken down by chapters. But if you're going back to this as a reference to find how they structured things, it may be a bit confusing as parts are getting moved around with every chapter. I wish they would have spent more time on using aggregates rather than a single entity, but maybe for a newer edition?Also I realize that I'm probably in the small minority who's not using a web frontend, but I wished there was at least some discussion about how to integrate a more traditional UI.They say clearly up front that this is not a DDD book and that you NEED to read a DDD book. Don't overlook that imperative if you're newer to the concept (Vernon's ""red book"" is what I found to be most helpful, but Millett and Tune's PPP of DDD is a close second). This book shows how you can use all of those theoretical concepts in a test-driven/test-first project.TL;DR:  If you're building applications in Python, this is THE book you need. It may not be a light read, but all the information is in here.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven Microservices"

"I'm a fossil, but I have actually moved mostly to e-books.  However, I purchase this because it looks so lovely sitting in the background of my zoom calls.Not really.  Rather expensive for decoration anyway.In reality, having this book is essential because it's like reading the dictionary when I was a kid.  I go to look up albatross, but there's albedo - I word I remember hearing but never really knew what it meant.  Just as with a map it's the same object you can see from across the room as you walk towards it to checkout one town, with this Nutshell book you can an overview of the whole of Python (through 3.11) filled with references to what tools and approaches are actually viable.  If there are four different ways to do something, which makes sense to pursue?The only criticism that I have (not because there aren't omissions or certain passages I'd take issue with - but they are far outweighed by the sound approach and scholarly efficiency) is that there is no section covering what's new.  There is, for example, an entire new chapter on Type Annotations - again an example of something I might not have noticed if I was just efficiently using it as a reference to look things up.I'm happy to say I've learned a lot from this book and I'm happy that the drought between the 2nd and 3rd Editions is a fading memory.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference
"I came to this book for a quick intro, which is what the term ""in a nutshell"" means to me. I have in fact read a few ""in a nutshell"" books, and those were concise and pragmatic.This work is not that. Instead, it is an (complete as far as I can tell) REFERENCE work which guides you through the minutiae of Python - and practically core Python only. It goes really deep on all topics that it covers, sometimes annoyingly (to me) so. Just a small example to give you an idea, most ""quick start"" books just tell you Python uses indentations for blocks. This book takes 10 pages to explain the lexical structure.So it's an excellent reference for when you get stuck with some advanced code, and to learn intricacies. And it's a great learning tool, too. I frankly didn't even know about chained expressions (a<b<=c>d), or that Python had type definitions and concurrency!There are also later chapters about files, networking, and such, but it stops there. No pandas, Numpy, or machine learning to be found here! If you want to become a true expert in Python, this is the book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference
"Python in a Nutshell is an excellent book for professional developers who have some experience with Python but want to take the leap to being a senior Python developer, Python in a Nutshell is required reading.This is not a book for beginners new to programming, and I’d be hesitant to say that programmers experienced in other languages should use this book to learn Python (but if you’re the bold adventurous sort, have at it.) But if you want to fill out your Python knowledge and go beyond a developer who “kinda sorta” knows Python and copies and pastes Python code from Stack Overflow without much thought, this is a book you need to read.In a way, the title is a bit misleading. “In a nutshell” gives you the idea that this book is small, but it’s actually over 700 pages long. Rather, this book is compact: it doesn’t waste time covering the basics and is quite dense with useful information.The density of this book sometimes works against itself; there were quite a few times I had to carefully parse out the words and could have really used some example code to demonstrate the concepts. I understand why the authors skipped it: not everyone will need the additional explanation for every concept, and providing these examples would have doubled the page count. (For example, the object-oriented chapter led me to take quite a few breaks to test out what I had learned in the Python interactive shell just to make sure I understood what I read.) Suffice it to say, the information in the book is useful and accurate. It’s worth the time it sometimes takes to parse through the difficult concepts.Other times though, it’s a breeze. There’s quite a wide range of topics covered in this book, and I feel like they do a good job going deep enough into each one without losing the big picture. And quite frankly: a lot of the information in this book just plain isn’t easy to find online. Without this book, you’d be chasing endless search result links to blog posts of varying quality, all while still missing out of several topics. The real value of Python in a Nutshell is that it gathers all of this knowledge into one well-written book.Other books similar to Python in a Nutshell include Fluent Python by Luciano Ramahlo, Effective Python by Brett Slatkin, and Serious Python by Julien Danjou. I recommend reading all of these books though; while they have some overlap they complement rather than replace each other. If you’re experienced in a different language but want to learn Python, Python Distilled by David Beazley is a good book to read first for general Python information, and then followed up by Python in a Nutshell.Even as a software engineer with years of experience in Python myself, I kept finding little nuggets of information that has filled in gaps of my Python knowledge that I didn’t know I had. Again, it’s not a book for total beginners but don’t let that scare you off. As long as you have the basics of programming concepts and are generally comfortable writing Python code, go ahead and get started with Python in a Nutshell.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference

"This book is ideally suited to people who want a meaningful introduction into the most important contemporary concepts in Deep Learning. The book is accessible to people who lack both programming and linear algebra. Neither are needed to get a full understanding of everything the book offers.IMO, the greatest moments in the book are the asides that appear in every chapter. The author will take a paragraph to note in passing things like '... no one really knows for sure why batch normalization helps. There are various hypotheses, but no certitudes."" Or, ""Importantly, I would generally recommend placing the previous layer's activation after the batch normalization layer (although this is still a subject of debate)."" There is even an entire chapter dedicated to musings on the future of Deep Learning and general AI. This is the cherry on top that you don't get with most offers. Chollet offers them in nearly every chapter.The book may as well have been called ""Deep Learning with Keras"" and that's not a bad thing. All the code is freely downloadable and can be run for free on a Google platform. You can freely ignore the implementation details and Python and simply run and learn from the notebooks provided. NOTE: As of February 2022, the new M1 Macs have bugs in the implementation of tensorflow that prevent a few code samples from working correctly. AND, some examples take so long to run (many hours) that there may be issues running them at Google. Frustrating though it might be, it does not detract from the experience.As to cons, I don't see enough to warrant taking a star off the review. All important concepts are covered at an introductory level. The code works. The writing is clear. The author is an expert. There is a bizarre convention of having diagrams flow from the bottom to the top instead of top-down.It's a good intro and basic reference.

"I wanted to pick up programming as a little hobby to do in my spare time. After stumbling through countless websites picking up little tidbits of information here and there (and spending ALOT more time and effort than I expected) I was starting to doubt if this was even possible to learn myself. As said before, I would pick up little bits of information and try to make my own little programs. I got very very basic information down but couldn’t comprehend how to to write anything more than a simple 20 line script. I was about to give up. Then I bought this book.and WOW. This book was absolutely amazing. I read it for hours everyday from when I purchased it. I finished the book 3 weeks later. I can say this book was monumental in what it taught me. (And it’s size too - LOL - the thing is massive but so worth the read)He teaches everything so simple and easy to read. Go through his lines of every example and try to understand what is happening. You’ll find by about page 500 everything is slowly starting to make sense. By page 1000 you’ll be thinking wow I can read and understand each example of code (even the longer ones). You start seeing how programs are put together, how every single line has a purpose. The syntax, the wording, the placement , the white space. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed learning programming from this book. It has enabled me to complete an online python course. I love solving problems on my own - each one is like a puzzle and I get a little joy when I successfully complete the challenge. Thank you Mark - for allowing me to experience this journey. I surely would have given up had I not found this book.This book is like sitting directly in his college lectures for a semester. Only I didn’t have to spend 4 months to get the information. I could learn as fast as I could read. All told it was a 3 week book for me and it was very very very worth it.

This is an excellent book for intermediate to advanced programmers looking for a methodical deep dive into the Python programming language.If you’re just looking to get started and up and running you’re probably going to find this book overly long and far too “in the weeds” to be useful. More frankly - I would avoid this book until your actually proficient with the Python language and actually want to become an advanced developer or you will be frustrated.Most people can get by hacking away at Python without being an expert at the language.There’s a large percentage of people that will be more than helped by the standard documentation that comes with a Python distribution and that is all they will need.“Learning Python” is more of an advanced text and would perhaps be more appropriately named as “Mastering Python”.

"I don't write too many reviews but I have to review this book. I'm just trying to learn the language to do some web, security, and rasberry pi development on my own. I tried to learn python over a year ago, got frustrated and quit. I tried to pick up the language again about 2 weeks ago. I have read and tried to work through Learning Python the Hard Way (LPHW). LPHW is a good resource and it did give me a general understand of the language. It teaches python version 2x. I have also read Dive into Python 3 (DP3). DP3 is also a good resource and it teaches python version 3x. I have also read and referenced  [...] For the most part, I am able to write simple code. But I got frustrated when I tried to review and understand complex code structures. I had a hard time understanding the nuances of the language. I spent hours searching online and watching tutorial videos. But I was constantly frustrated because there were all these exceptions that didn't make sense to me. I kept on asking why this works and why that does not work.The best thing about this book is that it explain the nuances of the language by giving multiple examples. So it does explains it in a complete manner. A lot of other resources will touch upon a topic and then glance over it. I often wondered.. what about this... so a lot of other resources expect you to test the other cases out which in most circumstance will be okay, but in others, you are still left wondering ""why?"". This book does not do that. In fact, I almost didn't need to try the examples on the interactive python command line because it was so thorough.This book is not for the beginner. You will get lost among the trees in the forest because there is so much information in this book. If you are impatient or need to start coding right away, you really won't be able to do this with Learning Python. LPHW and DP3 are much better at getting you up and running. But to write error free code, you have to understand the nuances of the language which Learning Python teaches you. Learning Python the Hard Way (free on the internet) and Dive into Python 3 (also free) are great resources to get introduced to the language. I would recommend both before you delve into this book. But once you get an understand of the basics of python, this book will fill in the missing details.As a disclaimer, I have only been reading this book for a day. I have already read 300 pages. A lot of it was review. But I learned a lot of new stuff as well that filled in the gaps. I have not read the section on regex or the more advanced sections yet so this review is not complete. But so far, I am impressed on the thoroughness of the subject matter.The main grip I have is that I bought the kindle version. If I read it in a linear fashion the material seem to flow nicely. But when I come to certain sections, I need to jump around. You find this a lot with any technical book. The kindle version makes this difficult because I cannot ""easily"" keep track of what I was reading so I get side tracked a lot. I also cannot effectively add notes (yes, I know I can add notes). I ended up using 4 devices to read this book just to keep track of where I was. I may get the hardcopy so that I have an easy quick reference book to look at later at my desk. With a hard copy, I use bookmarkers that I can quickly page to. I know about the kindle bookmarks but they are cumbersome to use. Fortunately, its hard to beat the fact that I can carry this book on my phone if I wanted to. So I would rate the kindle version 3 stars.Overall, I would buy this again on kindle.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning Python: Powerful Object-Oriented Programming
"This is a great, thorough, quality book on Python, targeted at individuals who have some experience writing programs, but who want to learn Python to write production-grade Python programs.All the people griping about how long this book is are obviously not the target audience of this book.  Yes the book is long, but to effectively use a programming language, there is a lot to learn.  And this book does a great job of metering out that information.  All the people griping about how there's too many ""forward references"" to other topics, are obviously not the target audience of this book.  Yes there are forward references, because there MUST be.  You can't learn every topic about a language in a linear way-- it's simply not possible.  If you are the target audience of this book, then you already understand that.If you've never programmed before, this is the WRONG book.  If you want a quick get-acquainted book about Python, this is the WRONG book.  If you want a reference manual for Python, this the WRONG book.  This book does NOT claim to be any of those things.  This book is a tutorial for people who have written programs before, who want to become an expert in Python.  If that's you, then you understand that the book is necessarily long.The Python language is a somewhat ""larger"" language than ""C"" or old-school Java.  So there is a lot to cover:  ""lists"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""sequences"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""dictionaries"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""tuples"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""sets"" are BUILT IN to the language.  This is in contrast to the Java language or ""C"" language.  This book explains all of those BUILT INS and ""why"" they are built in.  If you aren't interested in any of that, then this is the WRONG book for you.This book also goes into detail about why the language is designed the way it is.  And it does this not only in regard to the high-level design of the language, but it does this for every nuance and detail of the language.  This is great information if your goal is to follow best practices when actually using the language for real world problems.  If you just want to write little toy programs and you don't care about best practices, then this is the WRONG book for you.The entirety of the Python ecosystem is MASSIVE, and this book goes into detail about a lot of that ecosystem.  (Although even a book of this size does not cover ALL of that ecosystem).

"At 65 I am ""In-Progress"" in Learning (attempting) Python. There is so much information out there on Learning and ""Using"" Python that it is very easy to become Overloaded and almost Entangled with Unexpected Results. The ""Learning Python"" book by Mark Lutz is Incredibly easy to read. Almost like a novel in some respects, where you find yourself reading one more page, one more section, one more chapter. Detail flows, and is presented in a meaningful way that you do not become exasperated with the volume. Mark lays a Path from the Start that begins with what Python is and Is Not. Then how to install, and entry to how to use. From there the Journey Begins. Learning, Experiencing, Practicing, and Acquiring the knowledge in useful bites, maybe bytes....Mark has such a Fantastic Grasp on the Python Language that he uses his skill to Be Your Guide on Your Journey to Learning and Understanding How to Use Python. Whether in a Large Program, as a student, as a hobbyist, or as an integral component of your office work. He leads you on a level, paved pathway that leaves you with a smile.  His approach is so unique, that many who suggest his work do so in the matter that it is ""The Best"". I have to agree. I am an engineer and use C++ at an Intermediate Level. But found Python to be Overall Cumbersome and with many holes and obstacles to implementation.Following from Start to Finish, my Linear Way, and probably as most will suggest more than a touch anal, none the less his Learning Python has lead me to Where I am Now Able to Construct Applications that work. Here at home, and out in the field. Mark has such a fantastic way of presenting data, descriptions and how to avoid syntax errors, that you will come to the same conclusion of the all the others; That Learning Python by Mark Lutz is the Pathway Forward.Having a Copy of the Book on my desk while going through Tutorials from Udemy and a few other On-Line Learning Sites has increased my ability to obtain and use constructively what I learn, and where to look when I am unsure. I am sure some would think of his works as a Bible, I would interject the caveat that ""Yes, but it is so Well Written and Easy to Understand"". Wars will not break out. Will maybe.

"Just as a background, I am a software developer with 15 years software development in C, C++, Perl, and some Java moving into a position working with Python for the first time.  I was looking for a good Python ""techniques"" and basic fundamental language guide book, which is why I turned to the O'Reilly line (I have so many of their other books, from Perl to UNIX tools, to Java, etc.)  But, quite frankly, this book by Mark Lutz is very difficult to recommend (skip to the end for the TL;DR).  In a short version, it is very amateur, both from a writing perspective and a software development perspective.For the long version, first the bad points...  The author is either a half-baked software developer, or he is very good at coming across as one.  Statements like ""Python is better because it doesn't have the costly compile and link-time steps that languages like C does"" makes me tilt my head in wonder.  Does he not understand that ALL program execution has to be compiled to machine code?  And that if it is not done at development time, then the user of your code will surely incur that hit at runtime through an interpreter or some virtual machine?  The reason C (and C++, although the author usually names just C) compiles into machine code ahead of time is to save the runtime cost.  This isn't a ""Python is better than C"" issue.  It's a simple tradeoff that any real software developer realizes and makes use of.  If you don't need the runtime speed, then improving development cycle speed is a good thing, yes?  And likewise if you need a fast execution, taking the hit ahead of time so your users don't is worth it.  This is software development, something the author doesn't display a good job of fully understanding.In fact, half of the book reads like this.  From subjective, baseless assertions like ""most programmers prefer single-quotes [to declare literal strings]"" (???  Certainly not in my experience!) to constant ""rah rah"" Python proselytizing over other programming languages (C is a favorite target of his), it all shows a very shaky grasp on the ins and outs of software engineering.  He slams C's memory management and ability to get to the guts of a program, yet that is often required to create a sleek, highly efficient program.  He attacks C's syntax and praises Python's indent-based syntax without addressing the fact that Python tightly binds pretty visual formatting of human-readable code to machine execution flow.  To a seasoned software engineer, this is all about tradeoffs and using the right tool for the job.  Python does MANY things well, some MUCH better than C.  It's about using a hammer on a nail and a driver on a screw.  But you will have to wade through pages of cheer-leading and preaching from the author before you learn to actually USE Python.  If you are a C developer buying this book, you'd want to get to the nuts and bolts and just figure out how to use this tool to accomplish the job.  If not, you wouldn't understand all the constant comparisons and claims of superiority over C anyway.  ""WHY Python?"" the author asks. Because it is the tool to use for this job.  It's that simple.  I don't need the immature and insecure attempts to self-rationalize why Python ""REALLY is great guys, honestly! Much better than 'C'!""  I just need to know the syntax, libraries, and tips and tricks.Now for the good:  all that latter stuff IS in here.  You just have to wade through the self-actualizing, childish ego-trip to get to the juicy bits.  So, in the end, I'd recommend it if you don't mind fighting your way through what amounts to a half-book's worth of insecurities to find the information you need.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Learning Python: Powerful Object-Oriented Programming

"The most amazing thing about this 1500-page book is that it's incomplete without its sequel, the equally humongous ""Programming Python."" This book gives you a detailed tour of the basics of the language, its syntax and semantics and just a touch of actual useful programming. The real work, or so I gather, is in the sequel.However, this is a review of this book, not the sequel. That will come in a few months (which right there tells you I reasonably liked this book).The second most amazing thing about this book, then, is how clear it is.Python is a language both simple and complex: you can learn to write simple scripts in a day or so, but there is so much more to it. It is good for structured programming, declarative programming, and object-oriented programming (at least). It has a huge library of nice functions and widgets to add in as you need them - and that's just the official distribution.Lutz introduces us to the language without assuming anything other than that we have a computer and are able to do basic things with it (including accessing the Intartoobs). He writes in a clear and occasionally humorous style, borrowing variable names and such from Monty Python (after whom the language is named), and giving examples that actually demonstrate the points being made - though, aside from that, most of them don't actually _do_ much. (Again, that appears to be reserved for the sequel.)For someone with no programming background, this would probably be a do-able book. For someone like me who has such a background, though out of date, it's definitely right on the beam. (I picked this up because I wanted to learn a reasonably modern programming language; coworkers recommended either this or PHP, and I liked the name of this one better. Seriously...) For an advanced programmer, familiar with languages like Java and C++, it provides clear explanations of how (and occasionally why) Python is different from those languages. (Python has an explicit design and programming philosophy, the ""Zen of Python,"" built into the language as an Easter egg.)There's no real conclusion to be drawn here, other than that if you are interested in learning Python, this is a pretty good place to start.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learning Python: Powerful Object-Oriented Programming
"I wanted to pick up programming as a little hobby to do in my spare time. After stumbling through countless websites picking up little tidbits of information here and there (and spending ALOT more time and effort than I expected) I was starting to doubt if this was even possible to learn myself. As said before, I would pick up little bits of information and try to make my own little programs. I got very very basic information down but couldn’t comprehend how to to write anything more than a simple 20 line script. I was about to give up. Then I bought this book.and WOW. This book was absolutely amazing. I read it for hours everyday from when I purchased it. I finished the book 3 weeks later. I can say this book was monumental in what it taught me. (And it’s size too - LOL - the thing is massive but so worth the read)He teaches everything so simple and easy to read. Go through his lines of every example and try to understand what is happening. You’ll find by about page 500 everything is slowly starting to make sense. By page 1000 you’ll be thinking wow I can read and understand each example of code (even the longer ones). You start seeing how programs are put together, how every single line has a purpose. The syntax, the wording, the placement , the white space. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed learning programming from this book. It has enabled me to complete an online python course. I love solving problems on my own - each one is like a puzzle and I get a little joy when I successfully complete the challenge. Thank you Mark - for allowing me to experience this journey. I surely would have given up had I not found this book.This book is like sitting directly in his college lectures for a semester. Only I didn’t have to spend 4 months to get the information. I could learn as fast as I could read. All told it was a 3 week book for me and it was very very very worth it. I’ve purchased his second book (Programming Python) and hope it will be just as good as this one.If you’re serious about learning python than stop looking further. This needs to be a book you buy.The contents are expansive and in depth without overloading you. It’s taught in a simple easy to understand way. And the appendix is well laid out so after you finish reading it and get into the nitty gritty of programming you can always know exactly where to look in the book to get help on how to do something. A+++.Again, thank you Mark.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning Python, 5th Edition"
This is an excellent book for intermediate to advanced programmers looking for a methodical deep dive into the Python programming language.If you’re just looking to get started and up and running you’re probably going to find this book overly long and far too “in the weeds” to be useful. More frankly - I would avoid this book until your actually proficient with the Python language and actually want to become an advanced developer or you will be frustrated.Most people can get by hacking away at Python without being an expert at the language.There’s a large percentage of people that will be more than helped by the standard documentation that comes with a Python distribution and that is all they will need.“Learning Python” is more of an advanced text and would perhaps be more appropriately named as “Mastering Python”. A very in depth book that only 20% of hard core programmers will find interesting.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning Python, 5th Edition"
"I don't write too many reviews but I have to review this book. I'm just trying to learn the language to do some web, security, and rasberry pi development on my own. I tried to learn python over a year ago, got frustrated and quit. I tried to pick up the language again about 2 weeks ago. I have read and tried to work through Learning Python the Hard Way (LPHW). LPHW is a good resource and it did give me a general understand of the language. It teaches python version 2x. I have also read Dive into Python 3 (DP3). DP3 is also a good resource and it teaches python version 3x. I have also read and referenced  [...] For the most part, I am able to write simple code. But I got frustrated when I tried to review and understand complex code structures. I had a hard time understanding the nuances of the language. I spent hours searching online and watching tutorial videos. But I was constantly frustrated because there were all these exceptions that didn't make sense to me. I kept on asking why this works and why that does not work.The best thing about this book is that it explain the nuances of the language by giving multiple examples. So it does explains it in a complete manner. A lot of other resources will touch upon a topic and then glance over it. I often wondered.. what about this... so a lot of other resources expect you to test the other cases out which in most circumstance will be okay, but in others, you are still left wondering ""why?"". This book does not do that. In fact, I almost didn't need to try the examples on the interactive python command line because it was so thorough.This book is not for the beginner. You will get lost among the trees in the forest because there is so much information in this book. If you are impatient or need to start coding right away, you really won't be able to do this with Learning Python. LPHW and DP3 are much better at getting you up and running. But to write error free code, you have to understand the nuances of the language which Learning Python teaches you. Learning Python the Hard Way (free on the internet) and Dive into Python 3 (also free) are great resources to get introduced to the language. I would recommend both before you delve into this book. But once you get an understand of the basics of python, this book will fill in the missing details.As a disclaimer, I have only been reading this book for a day. I have already read 300 pages. A lot of it was review. But I learned a lot of new stuff as well that filled in the gaps. I have not read the section on regex or the more advanced sections yet so this review is not complete. But so far, I am impressed on the thoroughness of the subject matter.The main grip I have is that I bought the kindle version. If I read it in a linear fashion the material seem to flow nicely. But when I come to certain sections, I need to jump around. You find this a lot with any technical book. The kindle version makes this difficult because I cannot ""easily"" keep track of what I was reading so I get side tracked a lot. I also cannot effectively add notes (yes, I know I can add notes). I ended up using 4 devices to read this book just to keep track of where I was. I may get the hardcopy so that I have an easy quick reference book to look at later at my desk. With a hard copy, I use bookmarkers that I can quickly page to. I know about the kindle bookmarks but they are cumbersome to use. Fortunately, its hard to beat the fact that I can carry this book on my phone if I wanted to. So I would rate the kindle version 3 stars.Overall, I would buy this again on kindle.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning Python, 5th Edition"
"This is a great, thorough, quality book on Python, targeted at individuals who have some experience writing programs, but who want to learn Python to write production-grade Python programs.All the people griping about how long this book is are obviously not the target audience of this book.  Yes the book is long, but to effectively use a programming language, there is a lot to learn.  And this book does a great job of metering out that information.  All the people griping about how there's too many ""forward references"" to other topics, are obviously not the target audience of this book.  Yes there are forward references, because there MUST be.  You can't learn every topic about a language in a linear way-- it's simply not possible.  If you are the target audience of this book, then you already understand that.If you've never programmed before, this is the WRONG book.  If you want a quick get-acquainted book about Python, this is the WRONG book.  If you want a reference manual for Python, this the WRONG book.  This book does NOT claim to be any of those things.  This book is a tutorial for people who have written programs before, who want to become an expert in Python.  If that's you, then you understand that the book is necessarily long.The Python language is a somewhat ""larger"" language than ""C"" or old-school Java.  So there is a lot to cover:  ""lists"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""sequences"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""dictionaries"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""tuples"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""sets"" are BUILT IN to the language.  This is in contrast to the Java language or ""C"" language.  This book explains all of those BUILT INS and ""why"" they are built in.  If you aren't interested in any of that, then this is the WRONG book for you.This book also goes into detail about why the language is designed the way it is.  And it does this not only in regard to the high-level design of the language, but it does this for every nuance and detail of the language.  This is great information if your goal is to follow best practices when actually using the language for real world problems.  If you just want to write little toy programs and you don't care about best practices, then this is the WRONG book for you.The entirety of the Python ecosystem is MASSIVE, and this book goes into detail about a lot of that ecosystem.  (Although even a book of this size does not cover ALL of that ecosystem).  This includes things like:  embedding Python in a larger ""C"" application, calling ""C"" functions from Python, properties, metaclasses, decorators, Unicode, exceptions, object-oriented classes, etc., etc., etc.You think it's possible to learn all that detail, learn all the best practices of managing all those language features, and do it in a 100 page book?  Well, if you do, then you are not the target audience of this book.  People who want to learn to use Python to do production-grade programming realize that understanding all this detail takes a lot of pages, it takes patience, and it takes forward references.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning Python, 5th Edition"

"Say you learned Python for a class, or because that's what the other cool kids were doing or for any other reason.  There is a knowledge gap between knowing how to write 500 lines of Python that works, and knowing how to work professionally in Python.  This book answers a lot of questions not easily found elsewhere, and points you well down to road of how to use the language for more than the occasional coding chore.  It won't make you a professional python coder - only a job as a coder will do that, but it may be able to give you the hooks needed to get that job.  At a minimum it can teach you aspects of the language and the python environment you did not know.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dead Simple Python: Idiomatic Python for the Impatient Programmer
"I just can't stop reading it. It is definitely not for beginners or people who just want to look through. It is a really deep book without redundancy and repetition but with an explanation of why Python works in that way and with the sharing of really good practices. The rubric ""pedantic note"" is amazing!This book is so awesome that I wrote my first review for a book on the Internet. Highly recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dead Simple Python: Idiomatic Python for the Impatient Programmer
"This book is anything but ""simple,"" and certainly not for beginners.This book a mostly excellent introduction to Python for people who have been programming for years.  There are no unnecessary explanations of what a loop is, just a to-the-point list of everything you need to know to transition from Java/C++/whatever into Python.The book skips past all the beginner stuff and covers all the things you didn't know you needed to know about Python (virtual environments, package management, etc.) in the very first few chapters.  It blows by all the basics, giving you a terse overview of the syntax, with variations, and some examples that limit themselves to demonstrating the topic at hand.  There are no long source code listings, no attempt to develop an app from nothing to completion.Because it doesn't waste time teaching you what a switch statement is for (or, rather, what the python equivalent is for), the book is able to cover more advanced concepts.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dead Simple Python: Idiomatic Python for the Impatient Programmer
"Amazing supplemental book to use with courses and online classes, I'm sure it's good on its own but  personally have adhd and find that videos for learning/practice and books for closing gaps and extra knowledge is best for me.Book Quality is fantastic! The pages are thick, with nice big font that doesn't seem to be wasting space. Easy to read. The writer has alot of talent. To be honest this may be the combination of studies I'm doing where things just click but this writer  Explains things in python that other courses and books simply just ignore or brush over. I have my book from my local library and honestly still want to buy this. I will say that if a personal is rating a book one star with no actually review. Don't trust it. This book is amazing.A recommendation for supplemental course for free on YouTube is Christian Koch for the basics and on Udemy he teaches everything with Pygame projects. Using this book and those coueses to get trained up for my compaies new direction in automation and my first steps to professionally learn python for work and these are amazing in getting me upto date.

"So far I've only made it to ""for loops"" chapter 4; but I think this is a really good book. I had an online class from a local University and this book has covered somethings that the class did not. Not that what the book covered and the class didn't has been major; but is interesting that only having reached chapter 4 in the book that there are things the class left out. So far the biggest change between this book and the class I took is that the book does a much better job of explaining for loops. I even watched a video on Youtube to teach you Python with no experience and even that did not do as good a job of explaining why a for loop is written the way it is. Being that the class I took was online and was one of those classes done in half the time (warp speed) I didn't bother to ask why a for loop is written the way it is I just wrote it and followed the class examples (and yes I passed the class with an A but Python is not my first programming language). I feel way more confident in learning Python after the book did such a good job of explaining for loops that as I continue with the book I believe it will explain things better then the class I took or the video I watched. On a side note the class I took, as all college classes I have taken do, required a book and that book just didn't do a good job of explaining for loops (go figure). You might be wondering why am I using this book if I took an online class and the answer is it has been awhile since I took that class so I need a refresher. Also the college that I took that class from doesn't offer another a following Python class to take unless you sign up for a degree program (and I already have a degree I just want to become proficient in Python). I would recommend that if you want to learn Python to use in a job to take at least one class from a college or another way to get proof that you learned Python other than studying it on your own. Also another reason to learn from a book with no class attached to it is you can learn at your own pace. Now I could learn from the book that I bought for the college course since the class only went so far into the book; but I just didn't find that book to be very well written and full of information one doesn't really need to learn how to program with Python. I feel like a ""college"" course book has a lot of bloat while a book like this one is more straight forward. A book like this one survives and sells or not because it is good etc while a college course book is chosen by the teacher or school regardless of the reviews it got. So after this extremely long review I would recommend this book; but I think one does need something (a class, certificate etc) to show proof that one has at least some Python knowledge outside of ones own studying.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming"

"With the lockdown from the global pandemic, I have been forced to work from home like many other people. Since my usual job involved supporting hardware, this meant I was going to be stuck! Fortunately, my boss said that if I could spend my time learning skills useful to the lab, I could count the hours doing that. I asked whether learning Python would count. I told him that I would try to create scripts to monitor my hardware from home. He said that was acceptable.I have some programming experience, but it has been years since I coded, and then it was usually for relatively basic tasks in undergrad. I was looking for something that would not insult my intelligence, but that would still be interesting enough to keep me on task. So, after searching around I found this book. I saw the highly rated reviews. I skimmed the language that the author used in the sample. I read the table of contents and saw that the second part of the book consisted of creating games in order to solidify the skills learned.Yes! This sounded perfect.I have not been disappointed.The book walks the reader through setting up (checking if Python is on the computer already, downloading it if necessary, using an IDE and what that is, etc). And then it moves on to the usual basic programming. The writing is clear. I had no problems with the examples and found the practice problems to be well chosen. I also liked the way that the author encouraged good practices such as documentation and testing.I am currently in Part 2 of the book and have been working on the first project, a game called Alien Invasion which is basically a version of Space Invaders. I am definitely enjoying that. And I can see how some of the skills I learn from this could transfer over into monitoring my equipment. Reading files, taking user input, opening windows, drawing on the screen, making calculations, all of these things are necessary for the game, and for my own goals.I personally never had any problems, but I also noticed that the author's website includes cheat sheets, solutions, and errata, not to mention the files suggested for the projects.I am not sure if this book is for an absolute beginner. My experience is too far from that for me to be a good judge. But I can say that a person with basic programming knowledge and no prior knowledge of Python found it to be a great resource.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming"
"Wanted to add in a few tips, so beginners don't get discouraged. Just started reading this book yesterday, and immediately I ran into an issue with getting Sublime Text to work properly. If you're having the same problem, here's what's going wrong. On page 9, the author mentions that you can skip the part that says to create a ""New Build System"" if Python 3 is running correctly. If you were like me and you did not skip that part, then you might run into some issues. When you get to ""print(""Hello Python world!"")"" and go into Tools/Build System, choose ""Python,"" DO NOT choose ""Python3."" By creating a ""Python3.sublime-build"" you are creating an extra, and unnecessary, choice under ""Build System."" Also, the program will not run if you choose ""Python3"" that you've created. So skip the part that says to create ""Python3.sublime-build.""When the author says to create a folder called ""python_work,"" you can create that folder anywhere, but you should actually create it on your Desktop because he later references it on the Desktop. Any file saved as "".py"" is similar to files saved as .docx, .xlsl, or .txt, so don't worry about messing things up or crashing your program; it's just another file. You can move that folder and file around, and it will still work, just like any other Word file.Also, when you see "">>>"" it means that you need to run in terminal session. Go back and read page 4 or 6. Or click on the main Python 3.10 (64-bit) application, to go directly to Python terminal window.Lastly, remember that this book was written in 2018-2019, so the author is using Python 3.7.2. We are currently on 3.10.2. Certain things may look and function a bit differently, but the program language and concept will remain the same.print(""Good luck and happy coding!"")",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming"
"I've had some programming experience in the past.  I've written very basic Perl and Python programs in the past, and have a solid understanding of the basics, such as strings, variables, functions, statements, etc.I got the book ""Learning Python"" and started going through it and was entirely lost; the book mostly focuses on using Python Interpreter for most of the examples, which made it confusing for me to follow along.This book, Python Crash Course is one of the best books I've ever worked with in learning to program anything.  The author explains everything in a very detailed, yet simplistic way, and even puts numbers next to the areas he's explaining, so that the reader can understand what area of the code is being explained.In addition, the book has numerous exercises to do at the end of each chapter that really give the reader a clear grasp of the subject matter that has been presented.  Most of the time, I tend to skip over these, because they seem so tedious and boring in other books....not so in this book.  The author tells you to go find a famous quote you like, and then use that to create an exercise where you're manipulating strings (as an example).I'd have to say that so far, this is one of the best books I've ever worked with in regards to learning programming.  If you're new to programming, and don't know what a variable is verses a string, this is a great book to start with.  If you're like myself, and have a basic understanding of programming syntax, but have some places that are still confusing (maybe you know how to get something to work, but not know why it works for example), this is also a great book.Best book I've read in regards to learning Python, by far.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming"

"This is probably one of the best introductory programming books I've ever tried. Back when I was an undergraduate, I learned Pascal (yup, they still taught it at that point), C, and C++.  Neither the professors or the textbooks were very good at explaining...well...anything. Luckily, I was able to figure things out for myself, but it really left a sour taste in my mouth about programming (I've done scripting professionally, but it wasn't my primary role).Fast forward to now. I have one foot in each of 2 worlds - behavioral science and IT (networking and security). Both worlds use Python. I decided to get this book and finally sit down and learn it (I was briefly introduced to Python when I was an undergraduate and asked why we didn't have a class in it, I would have preferred it). This book has very clear, concrete examples and you learn by doing. For the first half (or a little more), you'll learn the basics of what you need to navigate the language. You'll do short exercises to lock in what you learn. Later on the book, you'll actually work on larger, more involved projects and the author guides you through with excellent explanations.Needless to say, I picked up Python faster than any language before it.

I got through the book in about 6 weeks (balancing work and personal life) and it is totally do-able. This book prepared me for the basics that were covered in class and allowed me to think outside the box when it came to discussions. The book truly gave me the confidence that I believe I would have not had otherwise. You do not need to know any fancy terminology or have ANY idea on how to create a programming environment. The book guides you through the entire process (creating a programming environment, downloading packages, etc)  and you can find the solutions to the problems online, the author gives you the URL to the github site so you can check your work.

"As a beginner programmer, I was searching for a book that would help me get started with Python. That's when I came across ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" by Al Sweigart. After that book I learned the fundamentals and tackled some minor python projects. ""Big book of small python projects"" This book has been a game changer for me, as it provides a clear and concise introduction to Python programming. The examples and projects in the book are engaging and have allowed me to quickly build my skills and confidence.One of my favorite projects from the book was the ""Maze Runner 3D"" project, which challenged me to think critically and creatively as I tackled over 300 lines of code. Thanks to Al's guidance and teaching style, I was able to successfully complete the project and add it to my growing portfolio of Python projects.If you're on the fence about purchasing this book, I highly recommend taking the plunge.

"Another reivewer noted he got 19 errors with a program after typing it in and using the diff tool. Pretty sure that person's using an old version of Python—like Python 2.7 or something old. These programs are written for Python 3, and the author's using Python 3.9 in the front matter. There are monumental, incompatible, irreconcilable differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x. The former has been deprecated and obsolete for about a decade now, and finally in 2020 it was formally killed off five years after they said they were going to do that. So … don't use 2.x with this book.The first program in the book is Bagels, a math game I remember from MECC Elementary Volume 1 on the Apple IIe as a kid. A fitting first program for a book where you're expected to type in a program, figure out why it doesn't work (remember that indentation is syntax in Python!) and modify it until it does what it's supposed to. This is how we learned to program when I was nine, on that aforementioned Apple IIe.Will you learn a lot about Python programming by banging this program out? No, the book kind of presumes you're at least passingly familiar with the basics of Python. Right, so you're going to type out this first, basic program and then try to answer the questions in the book (and then modify the code to see if you were right. What do you get out of doing that?1. You are reading Python code and tracking indentation levels. Again, that's syntax in Python.2. You are typing out Python code that actually does something when you run it. You cannot get good at this stuff by _reading_ a programming book. You have to get good by actually writing code into an editor and making it work. Because the first time you do it, unless you're very slow, very methodical, and very careful in your transcription … it won't.3. By answering the questions in the book looking at your code, you're having to think about what the code actually does and doesn't do, as well as how the program works.4. By modifying the program to see if you were right as soon as you guess what it'll do, you're cementing the correct answer into your brain, even if your guess was wrong. There are two opportunities to learn something: Before you're tested on your knowledge, and immediately after. Both work!And that's just the first program.The programs get more complex (but not necessarily much longer). Can't promise that any of the programs in the book will change your life as they are, but they will show you how a bunch of little things are efficiently done using Python so that when you need to do something like that yourself, you're gonna remember that you saw something like that in this programming book.And that's the point: To make you a fluent programmer using python.Four stars instead of five because the questions asked at the end of each program are a bit hokey at times. Should've done a bit more beta-testing on those, Mr. Sweigart. As they are, the reader might be tempted to skim past them to the next program (which would be a mistake, don't do that!)Overall, it's good for what it is.

"I am considering trying a Kaggle competition for the first time, and the Kaggle Workbook is very motivating, as well as helpful in giving me an intro to methods and practices in the space.First off, the book itself looks great.  The cover is attractive and feels good.  The book is thin, and easy to carry around and read anywhere, and it's not overwhelming w/content.  The text looks good and is easy to read.  The code listings are very clean, well-spaced, and also easy to read.I am particularly interested in the NLP example.  I like that they provide a basic baseline solution, as well as more advanced techniques from solutions which did well in past competitions.  They present the evaluation metric used, which was a new metric, and encourage the reader to pursue it further in the competition forum where there has been a lot of discussion amongst participants.I like the workbook format.  The NLP chapter contains 9 Exercises, and these are each presented in a page-length box with the exercise stated at the top and the rest of the page left as space for you to write notes.  I think this is a nice practice which can be used on other problems; i.e. be intentional about coming up with questions about the problem and solution and make sure you spend some time trying to answer them.  For example, ""inspect the differences between the tokenizers used in the Transformers library.  Would another choice have been better?"" and ""Can you think of a way to speedup the code?"".The code is available and they have a Discord space for the book.I also like that in the forecasting challenge chapter that they include a short interview with a person who scored in the top 5 and whose solution the authors found most interesting.I think both this Kaggle Workbook, and the Kaggle Book are great.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Workbook: Self-learning exercises and valuable insights for Kaggle data science competitions

"Who is this book for?Those with familiarity with python and machine learning frameworks will be undaunted in working through this book.What makes this book special?When talking about Kaggle most will say it is one of the best places to learn machine learning. I would argue Kaggle + a guide like this is one of the best ways to learn machine learning (intermediate-advanced). Kaggle has had numerous competitions over the years and by picking up an archived competition someone can learn a lot about the current state of the art. However, without having actively participated in the competition it is hard to take in the sheer quantity of high ranked posts in the discussions and notebook sections. ""The Kaggle Workbook"" acts as a high quality pair programmer for the competitions the book covers and references lots of high quality posts from previous competitions.To make it more concrete, here are two examples of this (first few that came to mind);- discussion post on reducing memory usage while loading pandas data frames- hand picked discussion posts detailing how specific metrics work for the given competitionAll things that one can figure out or find with time, but it is nice to be given the information from a filtered source. This is nice because technically Kagglers can explain things incorrectly (even without the intent of doing so) and you may internalize something incorrectly while learning.Additional Pros In General:- learn how to recreate top solutions from previous competitions- learn how to quickly start competitions of the different domains covered in this book (doesn't only show a final product but instead motivates each section)- introduces you to Tez, a trainer framework made by Abhishek Thakur, for using less boiler plate in training loops. Note: the book only briefly touches on Tez but in a way this section serves more to diversify the perspective of the reader, i.e. it is not always necessary to start from scratch when working on machine learningA single con:It reads like possibly certain sections that come later may have been written with the intention of being shown first because there are one or two times when a technique is used assuming the reader has a priori knowledge of it but is later explained. Very easy to overcome with googling or looking deeper in the book at times.Overall, this book was a nice read and it was nice to be affirmed in the ways I approach problems but also learn a whole lot of new things.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Workbook: Self-learning exercises and valuable insights for Kaggle data science competitions
"Kaggle is an abundant source of knowledge, but compiling and structuring all the information it offers can pose a challenge.

"Thanks to an invite from Packt and Monika Sangwan, I have had the opportunity to review ""The Kaggle Workbook"" by Konrad Banachewicz and Luca Massaron.This book is a comprehensive and practical guide for data science enthusiasts who want to enhance their skills on Kaggle, the world's largest community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. It covers competitions in four types of data - tabular, time-series, image, and text.One of the key strengths of the book is its practical approach. Each chapter is structured in a way that mirrors how one would approach a Kaggle competition, from understanding the data and competition metrics to the winning approach. Additionally, the authors provide clear explanations of key concepts, making it accessible to beginners while still providing valuable insights for more experienced data scientists.There are several best uses for this book:- Before reading the book, attempt the competition with your proposed approach and compare the winning approach in the book with your proposed approach.- Understand the overall approach in each chapter (competition) and see if you can replicate it in a similar competition/work project for a quick baseline.- Keep the winning tricks in your back pocket and use them whenever appropriate.Overall, ""The Kaggle Workbook"" is a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their data science skills and compete on Kaggle. Its practical approach, clear explanations, and focus on real-world strategies make it a must-read for both beginners and experienced data scientists alike.Great job, Konrad Banachewicz and Luca Massaron!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Workbook: Self-learning exercises and valuable insights for Kaggle data science competitions

"I had the privilege of reading the reviewers copy of the book and I can say this is a very detailed guide from kaggle grandmasters. To be honest, I have only used Kaggle for school work back when I went to college but this has renewed my interest to use it more often to sharpen my skills.The book provides real life case studies on how to approach and solve various machine learning competitions. It covers four different competitions, each with its unique challenges and datasets. It looks like you will benefit more if you also get Kaggle Book as the authors refer a lot of materials and exercises in that book.The exercises cover tabular, time-series, vision and NLP problems. You will go in great details how to properly implement lightGBM, denoise autoencoders and how effectively blend different models to improve your performance, True what they say, just learn gradient descent. I particularly like how in the vision competition they have done a good job of how to build a complete pipeline for image classification.Winning kaggle competitions aside, the authors provide a lot of valuable knowledge that is worth buying the book. I would definitely give it a 10/10 and look into getting the Kaggle Book as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Workbook: Self-learning exercises and valuable insights for Kaggle data science competitions
The universe finally makes sense after reading this book and watching Dr. Brunton's lectures.The reader starts the journey with an elegant explanation and application of eigenvector and eigenvalues. Then Fast Fourier Transform is demystified; reinforcement learning's Bellman equation finally makes sense; major machine learning/ deep-learning algorithms are put into context.  The Python codes make the theories clear and immediately applicable to real-life problems.The book covers advanced concepts like the application of Koopman operators and Sparse identification of Nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to model chaotic systems.  The reader learns that neural networks can represent Koopman embedding.Thank you Dr. Brunton for your lectures and beautiful book,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Data-Driven Science and Engineering: Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, and Control"

"(Disclaimer: I was asked to review this book by the publisher, but otherwise have no connection with the author or publisher.)Practical Data Science by Nathan George  is a big book, weighing in at nearly 600 pages and it has big ambitions - to serve as an introduction to Python programming, data wrangling and engineering, and data science. The amount of information it presents is impressive and of high quality - as I have gone through this book I haven't found anything I'd say was wrong.The content is well organized, with a logical progression of topics, and for most sections a number of alternatives are presented, which I found nice - some of them were new to me, and it's always nice to pick up a new tool or two. And the material presented is sound, following standard practices. For example, the text processing chapter is a good presentation of the steps and options one would encounter in preparing and analyzing free form text.So overall, I think this will be a useful book for intermediate and even advanced data engineering/data science practitioners who want to fill in a gap or refresh their memories on one of the many topics presented. If you know Python and have done some data engineering or data science, you will find this book to be a handy reference.I would not however recommend this book for beginners, even though beginners are one of the stated target audiences. Based on my experience, I would say that the material is presented at too high a level, too quickly, and without enough elaboration of the examples for beginners. The section on Python itself bothers me most in this regard, where too often the resulting state after some code executes is not shown or explained, and where a level of knowledge is assumed that is beyond many beginners. But the same issue exists in the other chapters, where third party libraries and ML models are invoked with only a brief mention of what they are and how they work. That approach is fine if the reader already has a reasonable familiarity with the landscape, but will inevitably leave a beginner behind.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Data Science with Python: Learn tools and techniques from hands-on examples to extract insights from data
"The author Nathan George takes on a big task with this book, and does a good job executing it. Data Science is a very broad topic. In addition, it inevitably overlaps into Software Engineering, Computer Programming, Cloud Compute, and many other topics. After a whirlwind review of the history of Data Science, tools, specializations, and project structure, the book moves right into installing and using Python. As the book is targeted at relative newcomers to Data Science as well as those interested to change careers, this makes sense, as the audience might know another language or analytics platform, and face a learning curve with Python.  I especially liked the inclusion of CRISP-DM and TDSP in the introduction, as beginning a project with a good structure is an important success factor, and both of these frameworks, one older and long-proven, and the other a more modern adaptation, can and should be used in a majority of projects.On the technical side, Nathan covers pretty much all the facets of supervised and unsupervised learning, algorithms, as well as newer ""Auto ML"" platforms including H2O and PyCaret.  If a reader has some experience in Python, and perhaps a little bit of ML exposure, a good way to use the book is to read the table of contents and go directly to areas of interest.  True beginners would want to read all the early chapters before skipping around.  At over 600 pages, there is a lot of material; honestly enough for an entire bootcamp. If you want to learn a lot about ML and Data Science on your own, you can use this book but plan to spend a few months to longer to really master everything in here.Overall, a very nice work which can be a great reference for your first few years in Data Science.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Data Science with Python: Learn tools and techniques from hands-on examples to extract insights from data
"First off, I found this to be an amazing book on data science.  I’m relatively new to Python and data science so the topic can be somewhat intimidating.  However, Nathan George’s style and approach is thorough, engaging, and encouraging.He starts with the basics and builds from there, with LOTs of practical, realistic scenarios and code samples.  Having some experience in Python will be beneficial but not entirely necessary as Nathan does a great job explaining everything from the beginning, including installing Python.From there he dives into a thorough explanation of what data science is and demonstrates many of the great Python packages and tools available to aid you in your exploratory data analysis and visualization including sqlite3, sqlalchemy, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, textract, matplotlib, sklearn, statsmodels, and more.  It was great learning about the swifter package, which automatically parallelizes the use of pandas' apply function.An area I never considered he covers in detail is data wrangling Word docs, PDFs, and Excel spreadsheets.  It was very enlightening and eye opening to discover how these types of files can be used in data science.And of course, you can’t cover data science without covering machine learning (ML).  And he goes into depth (many chapters) explaining ML, covering supervised and unsupervised learning.  And he stresses the importance of having clean data for ML to work with.  He shows you various techniques to clean and prepare your data for ML.Throughout the book, Nathan encourages you to follow along, and points you to various code samples and files on a GitHub repo, and at the end of each chapter has a “Test Your Knowledge” section where he encourages you to put what you just learned into practice to help solidify your knowledge.I enjoyed his chapter on Ethics and Privacy.  It’s great to learn about data science but it’s important to learn how to use it ethically, consider bias, and to consider people’s privacy when doing so.  He walks through several examples of how to achieve the results we desire but to do so in an ethical way.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning data science or learning more in-depth data science techniques.  You will find it all in this book, covered in detail and thoroughly explained in a step by step, encouraging approach.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Data Science with Python: Learn tools and techniques from hands-on examples to extract insights from data
"**Full disclosure, I was a student of Dr. George and purchased the book directly from Packt.**I highly recommend the book for newcomers to data science or those that have a general understanding of data science but want to solidify concepts and advance their knowledge. The book provides a nice balance of providing the reader with enough detail on each topic without overloading the reader using material that is too complex. Often books in the data science domain are too basic and do not cover more advanced subject matter or the author assumes prior knowledge leaving the reader feeling lost and confused. Dr. George navigates these challenges well and starts the reader out with an introduction on getting started with Python to eventually walking the reader through supervised learning techniques such as boosted trees and SVM, as well as unsupervised learning techniques such as K-means clustering. I found the sections on feature selection/engineering and optimizing models very comprehensive, including a wide range of techniques and options. A nice addition to the book was the inclusion of AutoML and PyCaret. That is an area that interests me, and I have yet to explore. I rarely write reviews on books, but due to the vast information nicely presented in an easy to understand and follow format, I felt compelled to endorse this book. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I do.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Data Science with Python: Learn tools and techniques from hands-on examples to extract insights from data
"As someone who knows almost nothing about data science, I found this book to be a solid approach to the subject. It is an appropriate book for those who want to get a taste for the different topics within the field of data science, even for those who are not experienced with Python.It spends a good amount of time going over the basics of Python, so if anyone is already experienced with the language, they can likely skim through to get to the content that specifically covers data science. After the Python primer, the book shows you a variety of Python tools for data science including sqlite3, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, and more. All of these are great libraries to become familiar with for data processing and analysis, and the book does a great job of exploring these tools in Python.The book also dives into the fundamentals of data science in great detail. It shows you how to manage and visualize data, explains the necessary probability and statistics, and explores the many applications of machine learning in data science. For those looking to get a good overview of any of these topics, this book covers them all thoroughly.I also appreciated the method by which the book explains its material. It uses plenty of code examples and plots with detailed explanations throughout the chapters to illustrate points made. It covers the mathematics needed for data science without being too overwhelming as other books might be. The book does a nice job of introducing these ideas for readers to explore further through external resources if it interests them.Overall, I think this is a great read for anyone looking to teach themselves the fundamentals of data science, as well as develop their Python skill set, whether for their professional work or just for their own enrichment!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Data Science with Python: Learn tools and techniques from hands-on examples to extract insights from data
"Nathan George has done a great job here.  There are many things he has done that I really like – and there is much more I want to dive deeper into.  Next semester this book will be optional reading to my students.  Here are some things you will might like in his work:1. Use of GitHub – all the code is available.  By using GitHub and you can use the GitHub desktop application, go into Jupyter or Python notebook of your choosing. In addition, there are other learning tools right there – videos, etc.2. Tools for Data Science.  Nathan explains why Python is a great tool in a large field.3. “A good understanding of some core statistical methods is a must for doing data science.”  True!  So many think you can use computing to avoid the difficult task of learning statistics and mathematics.  You cannot replace knowledge with computing power.  Nat4. The treatment of Python is very accessible to beginners and yet, the most advanced pros will learn something in reading this book.5. I like the fact that Nathan includes Anaconda and some of the best python development tools and libraries.6. Version control with Git.7. I am a big fan of “Part III - Statistics for Data Science”.8. Nathan appears to be an AC/DC fan (based on some examples) – me too.9. Classical ML like partitioning trees, SVM and other techniques are included as well as more recent advances like AutoML, Gradient boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost.Nathan, I know that writing a book is a daunting task and so I appreciate the effort you have made.

"BLUF: If you want to get into Data Science but are put off by the staggering amount of information out there, this book is for you.PROS:- Basic enough but not entry-level.

"I sincerely appreciate the author for making the effort and this is possibly a good starting place for a beginner data scientist or ML engineer. I find it hard to follow as it switched quicky from generic ideas to specific examples. There is a common pattern that continuously repeats itself and doesn't provide fundamental knowledge, but rather a single practitioners experience. I wonder how many experts reviewed this book and gave feedback. Finally, it feels more aligned with data science or ML research. There seems to be a lot of missing info on mlops (while I naively assumed the whole book would focus on this). I think there are much better reads on ML systems or an experienced ML engineering would benefit from more general software engineering reads like ""designing data intensive applications"", ""pragmatic programmer"" or ""fundamentals of data engineering"".",3.0 out of 5 stars,Designing Machine Learning Systems: An Iterative Process for Production-Ready Applications

"I liked how author is very articulate and covers a wide range of topics that would be useful knowledge as someone who wants to venture into the field of ML engineering. Many concepts are very important data science practitioners to learn at companies that rely on data science but place little emphasis on ML engineeringFor experienced / senior ML engineering professionals, this book feels like a grad course reading material on ML system, and less focus on proven practical patterns for large scale machine learning. In other words, if your ML team is not doing very advanced ML system engineering (i.e. low throughput usecases or heavy usage of 3rd party ML platforms / open source solutions), then this book offers enough reference to drive ML projects. However, for serious low-latency / high-throughput / novel usecases (ads, web-scale relevance, search, autonomous driving, quant, or even LLM), this book is too surface level to offer meaningful next step guidance imho.I wish there's some equivalent DDIA version on ML system design that dissects some publicly available web-scale ML systems and discuss different design tradeoffs.

"I am a PhD student, and have been working to apply ML to different domains for a few years. Recently, I started working with undergrad researchers who did not have any prior experience with ML applications, besides a class or so. But, there is a lot of knowledge that is just collected over the years while debugging problems, discussing with lab mates, or through the many blog posts online. These are the kind of issues that rarely come up in classes --- not just conceptual AI issues -- but how to deal with data / features / efficiently store things / logging etc. In the few chapters I have read through, I found this book to be like the collecting together and unifying the best blogposts and folk wisdom for practical, day to day ML issues. There were a whole lot of things that I did not know, or was curious about, but didn't know where to look for precise answers.

"I was really disappointed with this book.  I was looking for something to walk me through using the different AWS services for Data Science and ML, and this is NOT that book.  Looking at the chapter titles and starting with the preface, it really seemed like this was going to be perfect to both explain and walk the reader through setting up these actual services.  But the content is really only half baked.After getting to Redshift in Chapter 4, I can only guess that the authors don't intend for readers to actually follow, but just to read what they do.  A few examples that lead me to think this:- At the beginning of the book, they don't state that readers need to have familiarity with AWS.  However they only seem to actually walk you through what they are doing half the time, so there is a lot of guessing (And I've been working with AWS for a couple of years now).- They don't provide any estimated costs if you follow the book.- The link to their github code has nothing to do with the book.- The Sagemaker example in Chapter 3 requires you to play with the Amazon Customer Review dataset on your own to copy what they did, when they could have easily provided this through their github page.- They don't provide any information on IAM roles needed to accomplish any of the tasks they do (At least they didn't in Chapter 3 and 4).  You can figure it out yourself if you really want, but now your spending a good portion of time just managing IAM roles, instead of focusing on data science.Other reviews seem to really praise this book, but honestly I can't find any value on a book that talks about AWS services without walking you through them.

"I bought the pdf version of this book at informIT.com. Since I have some background in probability - a key concept in statistics -, I've started my learning from chapter 6, which is well written and explained - Illustrations are a plus. Each topic is introduced by using a nice context - for instance, when it says how the t-distribution was conceived. Codes are written in the R language - version 3.1 - and are available for free at informIT. I am using this book along with Applied predictive analytics from O'reilly - Currently, I'm reading chapter 3, Data understand.

Great book and an excellent introduction to the field.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Getting Started with Data Science: Making Sense of Data with Analytics (IBM Press)
"The author, Murtaza Haider, has done a commendable job in writing a very good book as a gentle introduction to the realm of data analytics. He starts out by presenting the basic methods and descriptive statistics methods for drawing inference from underlying data. The bulk of the methods covered can be found in a good statistics textbook and the book has plenty of illustrations and lucid explanations on using these techniques. The major highlight of the book is the “story telling” the author has adopted. This is sorely missing in many of the texts on data science and predictive models. Another highlight is a chapter on spatial data analytics with GIS-related data.However, if the reader is already familiar with basic statistics and is more interested in predictive modeling using machine learning techniques -and this is what most people who see the term “Data Science” in the title expect, then they will be disappointed. The author barely touches on the predictive aspects of data science and glosses over several of the techniques. For instance, the decision tree models are barely covered in 1 or 2 pages, although the term is referenced in many others. There’s no chapter dealing with basic predictive methods such as: apriori algorithms, random forests, or ensembles. All these methods are mentioned in passing in the last chapter titled “Data Mining for Gold”.All in all, a good stats textbook but prepare to be disappointed if you’re looking for a good text on predictive aspects of data science.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Getting Started with Data Science: Making Sense of Data with Analytics (IBM Press)
"'Getting Started with Data Science' is unable to get you started in the field of Data Science, in my honest opinion. I really liked the emphasis to tell stories about your data but that's it. I liked the content up until chapter 5. But I really disliked chapter 6 which forced me to stop reading any further. In an example on Hypothesis Testing, author took all the data for the 2 populations to compare means. If we have the information about the actual populations, why would we hypothesize something about it? Also, there is no explanation about confidence level (described as a ""threshold value"" in the book) and level of significance. The author didn't bother to explain anything about sampling distribution of means, which is fundamental to understand standard error and critical z-value & t-value.It is very hard for me to continue reading this book because I am not satisfied with the content that I already know about.

"This book is impressive for both the breadth and depth of the topics covered.  It fully explores the degree to which data science has revolutionized research and development across the entire spectrum of industry in the last 20 years.  A leader in data science has the double-sided challenge of being both expert in the technical work and cutting edge frontier of science while also being able to make business-focused management decisions about that work and to communicate ambitions, process, and results to the (sometimes less-technical) corporate leadership.  This book provides information, examples, and key principles for both and so much more.  Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,How to Lead in Data Science
"TL:DR This book leans into the concepts of designing good data products and good data teams. It does not teach algorithms, how to make friends, or the hottest tool right now.Notice: I won this book at a drawing during a meetup session with the authors. I was not paid to write this review. This is my opinion as a data professional for 20+ years.This book has a zen-like structure and readability. The first place of this is right on their table of contents; parts by persona and sections by skills. Why is this helpful is you'll never feel lost once you understand that the authors establish this path. If you open to a part and section that you feel pertains to your position now and it's too easy, flip further into the book. Too hard, flip to the previous parts and same section. I can't say it's a balanced tree but it sure felt some kind of tree!In terms of the content, when you are an expert of a subject, explanations of what you know is fluid and easy.  When you are a master of the subject the explanation is simple, memorable and applicable at any stage. This book is the later. The stories in the book are IRL examples from both author's journey as examples of the concepts. There aren't many books so crafted and told in such a genuine tone to help curious data professionals but if you're not sure I recommend going through the tables and Figures of the book before you read. The tables are the sections ""in a nutshell"" and deserve to be printed and tacked on to any whiteboard.",5.0 out of 5 stars,How to Lead in Data Science

It also walks through related algorithms. Each chapter typically involves real world examples—making maps, searching a book, etc. Definitely plenty of coffee based examples. The author uses tons of humor and puns which I enjoyed. But if you want a no-nonsense approach then probably don’t want to buy a book with fun in the title.As stated the pseudo-code examples are a little tricky to follow due to the mix of explanations, C type structs, Python like white space, and types (written out rather than usual abbreviations). This being said the illustrations with the code are excellent and walk through the main methods on each data structure. Also lack of BigO notation for the algorithms is a little disappointing.

"I'm currently a graduate student in social psychology looking to transition into data science. Over the past year, I've spent an inordinate amount of time researching data science and attempting to plan out my transition from academia to industry. Despite my best attempts, I felt completely overwhelmed and confused by everything.  There were no mentors in academia that were willing or able to help me in my data science endeavor, so I was ready to give up.On a whim, I emailed the author of an article I had read about transitioning from academia to industry (Emily Robinson) asking for help and guidance regarding my own transition. She helpfully pointed me to the new book she was working on with Jacqueline Nolis that she promised would help me make a smooth transition to a career in data science.The book, Build a Career in Data Science, proved to be exactly what I needed. In clear terms, the book exhaustively details every step of the process for not only getting your first job in data science, but how to advance and succeed in that job. The book went over different kinds of data science jobs, the most common kinds of companies that hire data scientists, which software programs are essential, how to go about learning data science skills, how to get involved in the data science community, and so much more. After a few days spent devouring the entire book, I was finally able to create a clear, comprehensive plan for transitioning from academia to data science. I now feel confident that I can reach my data science career goals, which is a huge relief.I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

"This book really puts into perspective the stages of projects in data science, how they fit together, how you go from one to the next, and what are the important questions to ask at each phase. Insightful and thorough, beginning of a data science project through to the end.One thing that this book seems to do that others don't is really get to the ""why"" of doing things in data science. It's doesn't just say ""let's apply this machine learning program"" but actually discusses the possibilities, with strengths and weaknesses, and essentially let's the reader decide what to do, with lots of guidance. It feels very deliberate and careful, which I thought was good.Other reviewers are right, though, that it doesn't cover much advanced technical stuff, so if you're looking for that, this book isn't for you. I think that wasn't the point of this book, though. It's more about how to think about data and using it to solve problems and achieve goals through a process.I like the writing style. It's a little like stream-of-consciousness thoughts maybe could be organized better, but it really gives the feeling that you know what a data scientist should be thinking. It's actually kind of fun to read, at least compared to other software books. I do disagree with one reviewer's comment that this book doesn't contain much new information. I couldn't find most of the contents elsewhere, which is why I bought the book. Now I feel way more competent talking to my data science colleagues about what they're doing, and I'm probably a better manager, too, since I understand more about it now.Overall, good book about process, goals, concepts, thought process, priorities, and not so much about how to do complex software development. Probably good for beginners, non-technical folks, as well as people who know how to write some code but don't really know where to start with data and data science (like me).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Think Like a Data Scientist: Tackle the data science process step-by-step
"I felt that the book lacked depth and it was just a collection of freely available material if one were to google on how to become data scientist. The book sort of organized the context for someone not to be all over the place and walked the reader starting out in the field of DS, but for someone who already has some experience in DS field this book would be too basic, so feel free to skip it.Many examples that were given in the book (enron dataset, etc) are good examples and the ones that are generally used, but I wanted to see something new. So once again, I feel that this book is a collection of material that can be obtained freely off the web, all it did was to put it in one place for you to read. If you are just starting in the field of DS, then this book would save you time by having everything fundamental for you to read, however if you spent any time with DS already, much of the book would be something that you already saw before.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Think Like a Data Scientist: Tackle the data science process step-by-step

"Most Data Science / Machine Learning books are technically demanding – this is not the case.But not technical doesn’t mean not important.The author has a deep knowledge of the topic – with “wisdom” (see below) that you rarely hear from practitioners, let alone academics.Highlights:Page 18: Data Scientists / Machine Learning Engineers (DS/ML) think different that developers.Page 24: How to pose a question that shows you can listen to your customer/boss.Page 71: Pretend you are an algorithm ☺Page 87: Why it is so important to stay “close to the data” – this alone is worth the bookPage 87: Not many experts would admit the following! “Many complicated algorithms might be understood in theory, but each has so many moving parts that we can’t possible comprehend all of the specific pieces and values……”Page 92: Always worth remembering, even though your algorithm might not care: check your assumptions about the data / distributionPage 96: Brute force for DS/ML: look through your data manually ☺Page 103: Why you should start with a simple algorithm.Page 164: Finally an expert who understands the link between DL and feature engineering.Page 167: When you should use Excel …we often neglect it or don’t want to admit it that the world’s number one data analysis tool is Excel.Page 202: I enjoyed reading relational vs. document oriented databases.Page 206: when to use databases and when not – rarely covered by experts.Page 211: finally an author who dares to state the misconception of big data – and what it really is.I would recommend it for any DS/ML/DL for a technically light reading – e.g. as a break when you think your head explodes on something complicated.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Think Like a Data Scientist: Tackle the data science process step-by-step
"It's an excellent, even mandatory book for your Data Science shelf.  I am glad I bought it.  I am 67% of the way through reading this book.  It has nowhere near enough material on some areas, though, and is just missing some material that you need for DS.  That's actually OK because of course no single book is enough to cover everything you need to know in a field.  Look how many books you may have bought just to get an undergrad degree, and I bet it was not just one book.So here is a list of good and bad about this excellent book.Its good points:The profit curve.  After reading this book, I will never use Accuracy to select a model any more, as that's nearly a worthless metric especially when there are marginal costs and marginal profits involved in an application scenario.  The book is just amazingly good on describing how to select models based on estimated profit, and foremost the profit curve, and selected other supporting curves like ROC area under curve.The expected profit computation and the cost-benefit matrix as a partner to the confusion matrix. This is great stuff.  It's not even described in other data science courses that I have taken.Other good points:  ...And don't worry about the other good points (there are some). The profit curve analysis, and the lead-up to that, are superior.Its bad points:p.224: ""We will train on the complete dataset and then test on the same dataset we trained on.""  What follows next the rest of the chapter is just an inappropriate error analysis, because it is overly optimistic (but otherwise the techniques are great.)  The models have seen the training data.  We should never completely assess (test) -- and base the entire remainder of the chapter material -- on error (accuracy) estimates produced from data that the models have already seen.In most chapters, there is just not enough detail in the material, to enable this book to be used as a ""correct reference"" basis against which to write your own working code as you follow along with the text in whatever computer language you want to use for analysis.In summary:The book is outstanding.  It is necessary for your DS bookshelf, but on the other hand it is nowhere near sufficient.The data science course sequence by Johns Hopkins University identifies many of the elements of a nice overall outline as to what DS practitioners need to be able to do (and this is not even sufficient either):Reproducible research; Experimental design; R programming (or python, or perhaps SAS or Octave, but some mathy language for sure); Exploratory data analysis; Regression models; Statistical inference; Practical machine learning; Scientific writing; Developing data products; Big data techniques (e.g. Apache Spark programming or at least MapReduce-style programming); SQL and NoSQL databases; Concurrent, distributed, and parallel programming; Advanced statistics (such as multiple testing corrections).This book by Provost et al gives just a part of the necessary DS material.  However the part it provides, is essential.  I wish the biological data scientists in academia would adopt and integrate the cost-benefit matrix idea and the profit curve idea into their model selection techniques instead of just using the accuracy metric mostly.Also a data scientist could do several follow-on added-value extensions to the profit curve chapter.  You could produce Revenue curve (or Cost) since sometimes that matters more.  You could quickly find alternatives which are nearly equi-profitable to the optimal profit but which exhibit (less revenue, less cost) or (more revenue, more cost).  You could detail the model selection and profit consequences of fixed budgets.  You could further assess the implications of marginal profit analysis on the optimal quantity when the profitability ratio changes.  You could directly assess the data science solution against the best business wisdom solution and estimate what amount of profit is lost when using the old business wisdom decisions.  It's a testament to this book's strong value that you can do a lot more based on its material.Nice work.  Recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking
"Data Science for Business by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett is a very important book about data mining and data analytic thinking.  In 1971, Abbie Hoffman shocked the world when he demanded hippie readers (at the time, a likely oxymoron) ""Steal This Book"".  While I wouldn't go so far as to encourage current and future data scientists to shoplift, I will demand that they READ THIS BOOK!Not long ago, data was difficult and expensive to come by. Today, we're living in a world of far too much data, vast amounts of cheap computing power, and way too many poorly defined questions.  Mix them all together and you're guaranteed to make a mess.Going from data dearth to plethora presents substantive issues.  In business, the balance between gut feel decision-making and analysis paralysis is changing, rapidly.  Whether it moves too far from gut to paralysis, only time will tell. Through Data Science for Business, Provost and Fawcett offer practitioners a guide to equilibrium.Read this book and you'll find yourself moving briskly down the road towards data analytic enlightenment. While not highly technical, the authors covers each topic with enough rigor to appreciate the tools being presented and the insights being offered.From the outset, the authors are clear about the book's objectives: ""The primary goals of this book are to help you view business problems from a data perspective and understand principles of extracting useful knowledge from data.  There is fundamental structure to data-analytic thinking, and basic principals that should be understood.  There are also particular areas where intuition, creativity, common sense, and domain knowledge must be brought to bear…  As you get better at data-analytic thinking you will develop intuition as to how and where to apply creativity and domain knowledge.""This paragraph makes me think of all those undergrad and graduate students studying Statistics at Universities all over the world, my daughter included, who are being bombarded by one math or statistics class after another (Calculus III, Math Stat I and II, Linear Algebra, etc.).  Yet, far too often, they enter the real world lacking ""data analytic thinking"" or a sense of ""basic principals""  They do, however, have a sense of being overwhelmed and under prepared.  The epic battle between ""frequentists"" and ""Bayesians"", takes a back seat to what should be the real controversy in statistics departments around the world, the balance between ""application"" and ""theory"".  The book's ""primary goals"" should be the walking orders of every statistics program at any college or university anywhere.From the outset (page 2), the authors state,  ""Data mining is a craft.  It involves the application of a substantial amount of science and technology, but the proper application still involves art as well."" Absolutely true!  It's great to read this stuff!  This is followed by a concise discussion of CRISP-DM, a well-defined data mining process, whose concepts are elementary, essential, and integral to the responsible, proper, and successful practice of data mining.From this point on, the authors proceed to accomplish their primary goals.  They present such topics as predictive modeling, correlation, classification, clustering, regression, logistic regression, linear discriminants, and much more.  Their presentations are user friendly, their real world examples are interesting, and their guidance and insights are extremely valuable.My criticisms are limited to their website.  The Data Science for Business site leaves me wanting more real world examples to enjoy, access to more resources and tools of the trade, more references to peruse, and a more rigorous approach to some of the solutions.  Perhaps Data Science for Business the sequel is on the horizon?Whether you're a seasoned statistician (or, data scientist), a young aspiring novice, or an adventurous business person looking to expand his/her horizons, Data Science for Business by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett is well worth the price of admission and the reading time you'll invest.Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett state, ""[i]deally, we envision a book that any data scientist would give to his collaborators…""  I'll do them one better, I'm giving it to my daughter!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking

"This book is so good I've added it to my Top 10 technical/business books ever read. My son gave me his copy and said ""I kept seeing this book on the desk of people I respect"". I'm currently on my second reading of the book in order to reinforce the concepts, and I bought a copy of the book for someone at work.So what's so good? The book is really well thought out and the grammatical style is top notch. The book leads the reader into some fairly complex topics without overwhelming you. That being said, some of the algorithms an statistical models can be a little daunting, but the book is designed to introduce the reader to a range of tools and models and not to make you an expert overnight. I found the book to be both pragmatic and concise, while covering a lot of ground. An excellent text for someone who is interested in the background behind many AI and machine learning algorithms, and are looking for guidance on when to consider different approaches.

"Context: I'm an MD, needing to communicate with data scientist to build a product.I've this far only read two chapters. My pattern-recognition ;) this far however, with an assessment that this will be applicable to the rest of the book is two-fold:1) Too verbose!Too much stuff on explaining the structure and purpose of the book. Could've been said way more succinctly, and therefore more clearly. The effect is that I start skimming.2) Not 'sharp' enough.The best non-fiction written for non-expert manages to reduce the complex into explaining the essence. Not making it simpler, and reducing crucial comprehension. But reducing the complex into its crucial essence.When going over different types of tasks; classification, regression, similarity matching, clustering, co-occurence grouping - the way they are described, there is essentially no difference between i.e. clustering, similarity matching and clustering; they're all classifications - yes, there is a difference between regression.In order for this to be truly helpful even for an absolute layman as myself, it needs to add enough crucial, essential distinctions to make the categories mutually exclusive. I can think about it, I can look it up. The book would however been better if the information was more 'sharply' communicated.So why 4-star?Because it is a beautiful balance for the amateur. Explaining basic concepts instead of trendy-applications.For future versions though, correcting for verbosity and greater specificity (essence) will make it a true winner.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking
"This book is ideal for anyone looking to understand data science, and especially those who might interact with data scientists at work.  Roughly half the book deals with the essential data mining algorithms. The focus is on understanding what the algorithms do, not the details of how they do it, so implementation details are omitted. The math is certainly discussed, but kept to a minimum, and coupled with comprehensible, plain English explanations of each algorithm. Each chapter includes a case study illustrating how the algorithm can be used for a real-world problem.The other half of the book (interspersed between the algorithms) deals with issues relating to design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment of models. Without understanding these crucial ideas, the algorithmic knowledge is useless. For example, the right and wrong techniques for evaluating model performance are discussed at length. A businessperson without adequate background could easily be misled by certain evaluation metrics, and the reader is taught to evaluate model performance with a critical eye.  There is also a chapter on evaluating and critiquing data mining proposals, which nicely ties together the algorithmic, business, and practical concepts discussed earlier in the book. Some case studies are revisited in several chapters at increasing levels of sophistication, making the book feel like a cohesive whole rather than a mere compilation of chapters. If you’re coming from a technical background, you will learn a great deal about the business and practical/implementation aspects of analytics. If you’re coming from a business background, you will gain an understanding of what your data can do for you, and how to use it to your benefit. The book is an intense but very pleasant read, even funny at times.

"Data Science for Business is an ideal book for introducing someone to Data Science. The authors have tried to break down their knowledge into simple explanations. I am skeptical of non-technical Data Science books, but this one works well.In the beginning we are shown the motivations for Data Science and what fields they apply to. Some examples include movie recommendations, credit card charges, telecom churn rate, and automated analysis of stock market news. The book avoids going into the highly technical parts of creating the system but gives you links for where to go.They do not really reveal the whole Data Science stack. For example Hadoop was mentioned as an implementation of MapReduce but they said going into Hadoop configuration would be too detailed for this type of book. I tended to agree, and even being a progammer myself, I thought they made the right choice to leave that out.Where the book shines is in the explanations. I am very familiar with expected value calculations and there was a chapter on this. It was a much better high level discussion than I have seen elsewhere, and they mentioned possible pitfalls of the expected value framework.I liked that the emphasis was on deciding what problem to solve in Data Science. The title of the book is appropriate as it is not just about analyzing data, but figuring out the business case. If you are new to Data Science or looking to get a high level overview this book is an great place to start.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking

I have recently read their last book, Data Science for Business – What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking. No suspense: it’s one of the best data mining book I have ever read. Its style allows the book to be read by beginners, but its wide coverage and detailed case studies makes it a reference for experts as well.As the title suggest, the book has a real focus on business with plenty of industry examples and challenges. The style is very pleasant since authors have made efforts to put the reader in specific situations to better understand a problem. To be noted the very interesting discussion of data mining leaks as well as data mining automation. The book is divided by concepts and provides a focus on them (instead of techniques). Although no exercice is present, the book could easily be used as a resource for a course.Each chapter is clearly divided into basic and advanced topics. The evaluation phase of the data mining standard process is deeply discussed. The section about Bayes rule is very well written. Data Science for Business is also an excellent resource to avoid data mining pitfalls. Chapter 13 is a must-read in order to understand success factor for implementing data mining in a company.

"Excellent discussion of data science methods without excessive focus on mathematical elements.  These are included at a level that can be understood for the skilled marketer who has background but does not wish to go deep into the math.

"I originally recommended this book for beginners in my review. I had read a few early sections that seemed ok. I’ve become more disappointed as I keep reading.A great example is the chapter on heaps. He confuses the definition with one specific application of a heap when he defines it as “a tree based structure on which each node keeps track of two pieces of information: a value and its priority.” By using such a narrow definition, I’m afraid the generality of this structure and its other applications could be lost to the reader.Wikipedia offers a much better definition: a “tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C.”What’s more, after walking the reader through a visual example of how items are ordered in a heap, he never provides any code to implement one. Instead, he shows how to use Python’s built in library. Since this book is supposed to be for “self taught computer scientists” and not “self taught Python coders,” this seems to be an egregious oversight.It would also be helpful if the author would describe why algorithms work the way they do instead of simply providing solutions. The book feels very much like an answer key instead of a textbook. Complexities are simply provided without explanation.Additionally, I’ve found a number of typos throughout the book. Overall, the book comes across as a rough draft that was published with no peer review or critique from peers.While there’s certainly some value here for beginners, I’m hesitant to recommend it because it seems to have a narrow perspective and relies too heavily on Python’s capabilities instead of teaching the underlaying algorithms.I won’t say this couldn’t be helpful to people. It definitely could be the text that provides the key insight someone needs as they’re wrestling with a problem, and it’s a decent overview of basic structures and algorithms.

"This book is well written and packs a substantial amount of information into a small number of pages.  It is best used to get a survey and overview of many of the facets of the domain of data science.  This book will not teach you anything in enough depth to actually execute it well — it will teach you just enough to be dangerous and not realize when you've gone off the rails.  I recommend it for managers who may never go into technical depth, for people considering whether or not they are interested in data science, or as a preview book to create a framework from which to hang more detailed understanding.  Although this is an introductory book, it assumes you can already program in R. If you can't, either accept that you won't be able to follow the specifics of the examples, or read The Art of R Programming and/or R for Data Science.I dislike that the authors make a number of categorical statements of the form ""Data Scientists do this"" or ""Data Scientists don't need that"".  I disagree with many of these assertions and I think they have taken a definition of ""data science"" which is narrower than the prevailing consensus in the industry.This book has some errors (see, for example, the confusion matrix on page 196) but overall the accuracy is above average relative to recent norms.As other reviewers have noted, the author's github repository for the book is currently empty.

"There's always that one person who is unsatisfied, but it sure as hell isn't me, because I knew what this book was going to be like the moment I saw how many pages it was going to have & how the early release version looked. I still preordered a hard copy (for sharing) & a digital copy (for carrying), because I knew this was kind of what type of book I was looking for & then some.The concepts are not astronomically explained, but with just enough depth that I can also individually explain to people what they are. What really stands out for me so far is after each or so concept, there is a section labeled as further reading (well, in the digital copy) that is usually at the end of the book altogether & I found myself realizing I have a lot of those books so the authors really know where to look & guide those who wanted more depth.Yeah yeah yeah, the codes are missing (as of mid-June 2017) but if you really understood / know which packages to use, you wouldn't need the code. The first half of the book are two three liners of code concepts anyways; it's the explanations that matter the most. The second half of the book is the good part, which separates a white hat statistician from a grey hat data scientist, which is exactly what I wanted in a <300 page book.Thanks for keeping me waiting since November though, thought it would never come!

"First of all, this book is not for you if you want a deep and thorough explanation of statistical concepts. It serves a completely different purpose: to familiarize a reader with high-level concepts; to enable them to continue their statistics education elsewhere.I found this book a very engaging read: it sets itself apart from other books on statistics in clearly telling which concepts are not-so-relevant for the modern computerized explorative analysis toolset. Many concepts that are presented in classic books on the subjects are rooted in 20s and 30s where computing power wasn't available and researches resorted to various pre-calculated distributions and formulas to do their work. A modern data-scientist's approach would eschew some of the old ways and instead rely on randomization, resampling and computing power.This book not only tells what something is, but also why it is that way and if a concept is still relevant today.I can recommend this book if your statistics knowledge is spotty or ephemeral, it serves its purpose well and doesn't bog down the reader with (sometimes) unnecessary mathematical concepts to demonstrate an idea.Why the four stars:1. Lack of examples in programming languages.2. Complete lack of exercises (at least 1-2 exercises are necessary).3. All scarce examples that are available are in R.

"This book is superficial. For full disclosure I'm only on page 90 which is in chapter 3, but I don't think it will get better.Basically it summarizes concepts at a very general level to the point it's not useful except to show you what you need to go buy another book to learn.So far it's style has been to give a couple paragraph overview of each concept, followed by giving us several references to check out in order to learn more. If you intended to use any of the concepts you would definitely have to read about them in more detail elsewhere.If someone is talking about stats to you and you need to be familiar with the terms  this books would be helpful,  or it could be good if you want a high level look at how stats concepts fit together before diving in to learn concepts at a usuable depth of knowledge. That could be pretty useful.In it's defense, after more carefully reading the back cover I  think this is what the book intended to be. it doesnt intend to teach stats or intend to show how to use stats in datascience.

"A reasonable survey of core statistical methods, not super-clear, plus a slapdash review of a few machine-learning models, with very little explanation.Pros: * Decent review of core concepts * Good coverage of importance of distinguishing between sample and population statistics * Better discussion of bootstrapping than I've seen anywhere else * Good ideas on dealing with non-normal data and avoiding the assumption that all data is normally distributedCons * Assumes that you know R.

Detailed coverage of mean, range, quartile, but rampant hand-waving when you get to bagging and boosting * Many of the math explanations are unclear or incomplete.

"This book is described as a resource for 'junior-level to senior-level software developers' who've been in the real world long enough to understand how and where the book's lessons could be applied. It certainly has the requisite technical depth in the form of things like entity diagrams and code samples to illustrate best practices in bias mitigation and socio-technical-ethical reviews of projects (among other things). Deeply technical readers will not be disappointed. But the audience for this book is broader, IMO, than just engineering folks, as its most differentiating attribute (to me, at least) is the attention it gives to adjacent domains that intersect with data science & app dev. As renowned ethicist Virginia Dignum said recently, there is no technological fix to societal problems, and that ""A multidisciplinary approach is needed at all levels"". That's where this book really delivers, pulling in threads from history, sociology, law, and policy to lay a foundation of context for comp sci practitioners to consider what their projects, contributions, and digital creations really mean for the world. The book also does something that so many instruction-oriented texts do not: it acknowledges the reality of organizations, with all of their people, politics, pressures, motivations, and incentives. There is a mountain of scholarly research on data ethics readily available to app devs, ML practitioners, and data scientists, but putting key learnings into practice in a product group under massive pressure to make a release schedule without cutting features is a different deal. I wish more work in this domain (and the texts they use) would give attention to this inevitable reality for the majority of application developers and software projects that make an impact on the world. 5 stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Conscience: Algorithmic Siege on our Humanity

"I very much enjoyed reading this book- cover to cover- the 380 pages of content- and then the additional glossary which in itself is a great resource. This book is not the ""nuts and bolts"" of how you do the standard statistical tests. This book assumes you have looked at other resources for the formulas.What this book does better than ANYTHING I have ever come across (and I have come across a lot of books on statistics and analytics over the years) is to get you to understand-really understand-- the key concepts, principles, assumptions and even mindsets that underlie the use of the basic-- and foundational-- statistical concepts.Prof Spiegelhalter has a remarkable ability to write and tell stories in clear and simple ways that get you to understand the essence of the principles. He walks you through many real and relevant examples so you understand the essentials of the underlying math models and mental models, and in parallel, that you also understand common mistakes and misconceptions.Some of you might say-- why do I need to visit-- or more likely- revisit these basic-- and ubiquitously applied- principles and methods? After all, isn't this becoming increasingly automated? Can't I just ""trust"" the outputs of my AI-enabled analytic systems?Exactly because the use of statistics has become so widespread, so deeply embedded in so many analytics and prediction systems-- it could never be more important than now to understand why people (and the models and systems they design) SO OFTEN misunderstand and misapply the basics. And these basics are foundational. They underlie so many aspects of modern analytics--- and even modern AI-based systems ultimately end up using these basics.All I can say is--- even though I have a MSc in Stats from Carnegie Mellon (1981), and have been involved with the use of data, statistics, analytics, and AI applications for decades-- I found Prof Spiegelhalter's way of walking a reader through the essentials of statistical thinking to be a joy to read. It has tremendously helped me to clarify my own understanding and mental models per statistical basics.This book truly works for people at ANY level. If you are just beginning with statistics- and you know the formulas but you still don't have the intuitions and insights- please read this book.If you work with stats on a regular basis--- EITHER because you are part of a team that uses statistical methods in your work products--- OR--- you regularly REVIEW work products that provide the results of analytic models-- You will find this book invaluable.And if you have to get other people to understand how to apply and how to NOT misapply basic statistical principles- this book is a hugely useful resource.Thank you Prof Spiegelhalter for producing this work. It is so easy to read. So easy to understand. And at the same time, so insightful, and so thoughtful-- in so many practical ways.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data

"Quite enjoyable and not so dry to read for a statistical book. Almost easy to understand but not that easy...Some point require more elaboration, for example in chapter 10, page 352:""the fact that this 95% interval include 0 is logically equivalent to the point estimate (-3000) being less than 2 standard errors from 0, meaning the change is not significantly different from 0""- i'm totally lost here, i failed understand what the author trying to tell. If there is any material in previous chapter that could help in understanding this sentence, the author should do some kind of revision before dive in. Otherwise, further elaboration is needed.""A two sided P-value is less than 0.05 if the 95% confidence interval does not include the null hypothesis (generally 0)"" -  Seem like a lot of info, but at the same time abstracted in statistical language. Totally lost. can use a bit more explanation in layman term about this ""p-Value"" in the context of ""two sided"", ""95% confidence interval"", ""null hypothesis"" combination of terminology.

"This is a nice analysis of not only statistics, but in many ways of the media as well. Media can twist study results to create a headline, but upon closer look what's declared in the headline is not really accurate because you have to ask a questions to see if the results / headline is significant. In terms of the theory behind the statistics, it's not a book that goes into the details of the equations. The equation may be listed or referenced, but not really explained, which is to be expected since entire courses are taught in order to understand and work with these equations. overall, a nice take on study results and really makes you think to ask questions when seeing study results reported in the media; quite relevant during these times, indeed.

"Though I am well versed in statistics as a financial professional, I often seek out books such as this one purporting to simplify the conceptual understanding of basic principles. Often my reading this type of material is to provide a basis for me to explain concepts to my clients and others in an understandable way.This book attempts to do away with much of the math and formulas of the discipline but to me the ideas became more of a struggle to understand without the ""convenience"" of math shorthand. Formulas are listed in the appendix but without the framework of explanation to make them understandable.I found the format confusing, often having to decipher the meaning of a graph, the details of a footnote and the textual explanation often on a single page. Definitely interferes with the flow of the material.

"Many aspects of today’s US House of Representatives—the expensive campaigns, the difficulty in having a one-on-one meeting with your elected representative, the lack of members’ time to oversee the federal government—are a direct result of its size having been capped at 435 members. That cap was enacted by Congress in 1929 so that one political party could gain a momentary advantage over another, writes historian Dan Bouk in the Epilogue of his new book Democracy’s Data. The cap let the party in power retain an extra seat.Prior to 1929, Congress frequently expanded the size of the House as the nation’s population expanded. But since 1929, the number of seats in the House has been fixed, and the number of people each House member represents has steadily increased. At the founding of the country, that number was typically between 30,000 and 40,000 people per member. Today, Delaware’s sole member in the House represents nearly a million people.The focus of Democracy’s Data is the 1940 US Census, but the story of why the House is locked at 435 members is one of those bonus pieces of context that make this book such a compelling read. This book is filled with details about US history and the history of today’s social problems—a history that today is largely untaught and rarely discussed.The text for Bouk’s lesson is the 1940 “manuscript census” — the digitized images of the paper sheets that Census Bureau workers carried from house to house in 1940 to record the nation’s data. The National Archives published digitized images of these pages on the Internet in 2012, and in the years that followed, Bouk and a few of his researchers read more than ten thousand of them. Some are reproduced in the book.Democracy’s Data starts with a meeting at the US Commerce Building of the “Question Men,” as Bouk calls them: the committee that met on March 3, 1939, to decide the questions that would appear on the next year’s Census. In the following pages, Bouk shows how these questions were influenced by the needs of America’s civilian, military and business leaders—as well as fears of the approaching World War and traditional American racism.In the following chapters, Bouk systematically explores one corner after another — some of them quite dark—to reveal untold details of the 1940 Census. Chapter 3, “Partners,” describes how this term was used to describe concentrated zones of same-sex households — “partners” — living together in places like Harlem, Greenwich Village, and San Francisco. (Confusingly today, the term was also used to describe Asian and Philippian immigrants living in work camps.) He then adds important modern context, telling the reader that for the 2010 Census, same-sex couples that declared themselves to be “married” had their data edited by Census Bureau statisticians, all to make each person’s data fit both the collection instrument and the Census Bureau’s conception of how data should be represented and processedBouk makes clear the benefits of a job with a Census Bureau at the tail end of the Great Depression—and the power that came with being able to dispense such jobs— in Chapter 4, “Counting with Friends.” The “friends” are the friends of politicians who were able to distribute such patronage jobs, and Bouk has uncovered many fascinating letters from archives to support his assertions. One delicious twist of this book is that Bouk frequently includes from the 1940 Census data for people whose letters he quotes, adding demographic color to the narrative.Throughout the book, Bouk dives deep as he explores how racism, white supremacy, and fear of Japan (which inappropriately translated into fear of Japanese Americans) shaped not just 1940, but the United States as a whole. He convincingly shows how decisions made eighty years ago are still with us today. He also covers the statistical indignities thrust upon Native Americans in the censuses of 1910, 1920, 1930 and 1940. On this topic, Bouk sadly misses several opportunities to go deeper. Interested readers will find significantly more information by using Google to search the Census Bureau’s website for the phrase “Indians not taxed.”One of the delightful aspects of this book is how Bouk periodically injects aspects from his own family history. The book’s opening scene is an encounter between “a census taker named Selena Catalano in the city of Rochester, New York” who “interviewed Nellie Oakden about her family:  about her husband, Howard, age forty-five, born in Pennsylvania, who had left school after the eighth grade; about Nellie herself, who had finished high school; about their children, beginning with the oldest, nineteen-year-old Joseph, followed by Hope, Howard Jr., Emily, and little eleven-year-old Nellie. Selena Catalano documented this encounter on a sheet of white paper about the size of the front page of a newspaper. Eighty-plus years later, all the data she recorded still exists. That is remarkable.”It just so happens that fifteen-year-old Howard is Bouk’s grandfather. “I never realized he was a ‘junior’ until I found his name listed on Catalano’s census sheet,” he writes.These kinds of details, personal reflections and context-filling make Democracy’s Data a pleasure to read, and highly informative.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Democracy's Data: The Hidden Stories in the U.S. Census and How to Read Them

RecommendationsThis looks like a rock-solid method to use, start to finish.

"Year 2016:  I don't exactly remember how and why I ended up buying this book.  It was the best thing I ever did in my pursuit of Analytics knowledge.  If only I had known about this book or Aryng.com, I would have saved myself a trip to  NYC for a Business Analytics boot camp and also saved enough money to buy a sports car.This book ought to be made a textbook in every college.  The Content is structured in a way that a 2-3 day workshop can be organized for working executives to make them data & analytics literate.  I loved the clarity, structure, flow, framework, and all the examples.  Someone with no analytics background can comfortably read and gain substantial knowledge, at least enough to have a conversation with those in-the-know and also handle moderate level data analysis more comfortably by themselves.This is definitely a must-read for those coming from a non-analytics background, no matter what age and employment level they are at.  It's a shame they don't organize workshops.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Behind Every Good Decision: How Anyone Can Use Business Analytics to Turn Data into Profitable Insight
"What a find! Every HR practitioner who wants to keep their job in the future needs to read this book.This book lays out a very pragmatic framework for solving business problems using straight-forward business analytic and has direct application for HR leaders and practitioners. HR needs to figure out ways to measure the impact that people have on business strategies and should be asking themselves ""are we using data to solve our most critical human capital issues?"". Not only does the book help lay out a good solid model it also addresses more complex approaches to data analytics but does so in a way that puts it in the right place. We tend to think that predictive analytics is the future. But predictive analytics and other more complex analyses are only needed a small fraction of the time.One more point.  I have a PhD from Stanford  and was struggling to apply what I had learned about research to business world realities. The business world does not give you 3-5 years to solve a problem.  At best you get a few weeks.

"I am a ""Data Scientist"" and my review has a slight angle from a ""Data Scientist"" perspective over the business professionals.  Data science eliminates hunch and guess and decisions backed by intuition.Today there is a tremendous demand for everything ""Data Science"", Companies need ""Data scientists"", IT resources are refocusing themselves to be the ""Data scientists"". Contrary to popular beliefs that Marketing benefits a lot from data science, companies are finding benefits across the spectrum of their operations.This book does an excellent job in this perspective. All the fundamental data analytics ideas are explained by almost plain words illustrating human's thinking process. You will feel all the methods are familiar even though you have never learned them because they are presented just as a codification of rational thinking in everyday life. Once the intuition is uncovered this well, the examples in the book look so natural and you get a way to start doing your own analytics tasks.It can be your first analytics book or an insightful book worth revisiting from time to time.

"As a career coach I often come across clients, who want to get into analytics. With the emergence of Big Data Business Analytics has now become a hot field where plenty of jobs are opening and more will open faster and faster. I was curious about this area, so I purchased the Kindle edition. The book is very well organized in four short chapters with an appendix. Each chapter is carefully crafted to lead a novice (or an expert) through the material to give them what they are looking for. The style of presentation is fluid and is structured to keep a reader engaged with great illustrations, tables, and other aids throughout. At the end I felt that this book will serve well for anyone--from a novice as myself-- to an expert who wants to learn more about specific applications.

"Review in a single sentence: An excellent combination of width, depth and humor. The humor part comes mainly from the cartoonish artwork and the ""story"" of a company growing and scaling up their data-game. There is enough width in the material to give enough information why each part of the infrastructure is needed and depth on each part of the infrastructure to get a proper view of it, while the dedicated focus is in the Metaflow and how it can be used as a part of the infrastructure.The book starts with generic discussions about needed infrastructure, developing environment and workflows. In my opinion this is excellent as it gives a view across the divide between science aspects and engineering aspects, everyone can benefit on knowledge of the other parts in the chain. After this we go into the Metaflow itself, starting with the basic flow handling, including splits and joins, of the model. This is then followed with scaling and fault tolerance and how the Metaflow handles these. Next stop is the production, here the focus is on stability. After this we go to interfacing with larger datasets, like stuff in the cloud. Second to last section is the using and operating the models which focuses on the differences between batch, streaming, and real-life applications. Last section is building and training a machine learning model with the infrastructure stack described in the book.As I mentioned, there is lots of width and depth in the book, even on the sections primarily focused in the Metaflow and they are useful even without Metaflow bits by themselves.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Effective Data Science Infrastructure: How to make data scientists productive
"As of August 2022, there are two essential books on MLOps (in my opinion):- Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen- this bookWhile Chip's book thoroughly describes the ""what"", this book tangibly describes the ""how"". As one would expect, this book focuses heavily on the Metaflow platform. However, it does a nice job of not only providing abstractions of how a generic data science ecosystem should function, but it also provides significant value on top of what is currently present online via the Metaflow documentation. My biggest worry prior to reading this book was that it would just be a rehash of the online Metaflow docs. This is certainly NOT the case.This book will be most valuable for those people evaluating MLOps/Data Science platforms and considering Metaflow as an option. Spoiler alert ... you probably won't find a more powerful, yet parsimonious, platform in the open source ecosystem. The thought processes around Metaflow's design and implementation as well as example use cases executed on the platform are all found within the pages of this book.Disclosure:I was both an early reviewer of this book as well as an early adopter of the open source Metaflow stack.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Effective Data Science Infrastructure: How to make data scientists productive

"Social scientists need a simple and clear roadmap when analyzing their text data. As more researchers engage in text analysis, we learn more about whether text analysis advances our insights and whether its findings lead to substantive discoveries. Are the results of text analysis leading to the obvious observations that we already know, or do they contribute special insights that we would not know otherwise?Text as Data: A New Framework for Machine Learning and the Social Sciences is a useful book that advances the field of text analysis and helps social scientists implement exciting new text analysis tools. This book excels in explaining the basic tools of natural language processing that goes well beyond the discussion of the simple bag of words representation. The book is at its best when it applies the tools of text analysis to actual interesting text data sets and discusses the insights one gains from such analysis.The book describes the common important text analysis tools such as supervised and unsupervised clustering, topic modeling, dictionary methods, prediction methods and causal inference. The book shows how to combine new sources of data, machine learning tools, and social science research design to develop and evaluate new insights.The text analysis tools are well explained. However, some explanations may prove challenging to social scientists who just start out experimenting with text analysis. Also, users need more information on computer software so that they can apply these tools to their own text data sets. It would be helpful to see examples of useful software such as R or Python, or excellent stand-alone packages such as Voyant.

"The authors try to give a high-level of the NLP area for social sciences. The first few chapter are used to introduce the reader (supposedly a social scientist) to a new framework very little known in social sciences, but I think we could say used broadly in the machine learning community. One of its principal tenets being: split data between a training and a testing set. Use training set to structure data, using the model that best suits your needs, discover some potential interesting concepts, and measure them. Then, use the testing set to test your assumptions derived from the previous stage.The reason why this may be somewhat original with respect to social sciences is because in this area,  to avoid overfitting or situations like p-hacking, the common framework is, before looking at data, to have assumptions and only then to test those assumptions on data.The authors try to approach this subject from a more high-level view, or even structural, where they focus not so much on the mathematical algorithms, but more on creating a new framework for researching, and en passant they talk about some methods that could be used at each stage of this new framework.Here lies one of the problems of the book. Sometimes, by being so high-level, the expertise one would need to apply some technique is simply not taught, and simply skimmed through... I my opinion they went too high-level. If it's your first book on NLP, you won't be able to reach the full implications of the authors statements, since the necessary knowledge is either assumed or implicit, and you'll just read those statements as slightly abstruse. However, by being high-level, and using a simple phrasing, they make the book also easily readable, for the most part, even if you may not be entirely sure of the full extent of the implications.Another shortcoming of the book is that it's easily noticeable that certain chapters were written by different authors, and there's a clear unbalance in the way concepts and the mathematics behind are explained/approached. Also, some grammatical typos seem to be present. Either that, or the English was simply very strange (I'm not a native). This points to a lack of proper editing.I still haven't read the part related to measurement and causal inference. I'll try to update this review as I finish those chapters.Pros:- Easily readable- Nice introductionCons:- Lacks presentation of concrete technique implementations- Not the best editing",3.0 out of 5 stars,Text as Data: A New Framework for Machine Learning and the Social Sciences
I run a business with a text-analysis product and have a team of data scientists working on this problem. This book is without doubt my favourite on how to use text to answer real-world questions.The difference between this and most other books is that the authors come from a problem-based perspective and describe how to use the various text analysis techniques to help solve the problem. Almost everyone else comes from a technical perspective. As such it's probably going to age better than most - I could imagine swapping out older technical solutions for newer ones but the approach is likely to be resilient.After working full-time in this domain for the last 7 or 8 years at times I felt I was learning something new every other page.

It is definitely mathematical and algorithmic in its treatment of the topics covered: Statistical ""Learning"", Monte Carlo Methods, Unsupervised ""Learning"", Regression Models, Regularization and Kernel Methods, Classification, Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods, Deep ""Learning"" ( Neural Networks )  As a statistician and data scientist, I find the convoluted ""machine learning"" terminology very affected and as helpful as trying to design a plane based on the flying dynamics of a bird.  Sometimes the rigourous mathematical notation is difficult to follow on the initial reading.  Most algorithms are implemented in Python but the code should be more clearly documented so that one can follow the implementation of the solution without getting stuck on coding issues as the book encourages the reader to focus on the algorithm and to not treat the python code as a black box.  The list of references is quite complete and it was interesting to check my library to see just how many of the references I already had.

"This book is a fantastic resource for anyone new to data or hoping to teach data thinking to others. I love the way the book is organized, how each chapter is a succinct discussion of a certain topic and also love the exercises in the back. At times the language can be a little simplistic if you're already familiar with many of these concepts, however I also love the simplicity and ease with which Bowen breaks down some complex terms and concepts so that nearly anyone can understand them. Perhaps the most important aspect of this book is the way Bowen breaks down the flaws in how science and data literacy is often lacking in traditional education. Sure most of us had a science course, remember learning about interpreting results, graphing and communicating results, but we have been lead astray as most of the examples in school were much too neat for the real world. This book offers a new perspective, a new way of looking at data that can correct some of the bad habits you may have been taught in school when you were young.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Basics of Data Literacy: Helping Your Students (And You!)

"I purchased this book because I wanted to understand how kids progress through an understanding of charts and graphs. I found many aspects helpful, such as the notion of moving from concrete representations (such as showing an actual distance on large graph paper with no scale factor) to more abstract, and the value of showing individual points surrounding the average on a bar graph.But I was distressed by one section that I think is flat-out wrong and encourages misconceptions. Scientists that I have checked with agree. The book states that there are three kinds of data, nominal, ordinal, and interval-ratio. Nominal data, like the weight of dogs, cats, and mice are best represented by bar charts. So far so good. The book then states that ordinal data are best represented by line graphs. The example given is the speed of poodles, Labradors, and Dobermans, with the idea being that these are in order from small to large dogs.Nobody I have checked with agrees that these should be represented by a line graph. These are really nominal data. A lot differs among these three dog breeds other than size. The slope of the line between one group and another has no meaning.Line graphs should primarily be used in time series graphs (rainfall per month, for example). The line graph helps the reader see changes between time points.The authors would do better to drop the ""ordinal"" category from their discussion and focus on time series, which are very important in scientific data, and on the difference between continuous and discrete data.",2.0 out of 5 stars,The Basics of Data Literacy: Helping Your Students (And You!)

"Don't get me wrong, this is a really good book. But this is a book that's stuck somewhere between a Mathematics book and a Computer Science book.Having studied the mathematics in ML during college, I'm already familiar with the topic discussed in the book. I'm mainly reading it as a refresher of linear algebra and calculus that I haven't used in years.It does a good job laying out necessary mathematical concepts, but it doesn't do as good of a job at providing proofs/explanations to a lot of the properties and extensions. For example, the book gives a good algebraic definition of orthogonality in terms of vectors and subspaces (inner product of the vectors/subspaces in question equal 0). However, in the next section about function orthogonality, the book just says ""functions can be seen as vectors"" and provides a definition in terms of a definite integral. The book didn't provide reasoning for such a jump from inner product to integral, nor did it provide explanations or intuitions for the upper and lower bounds of the integral. There are many more examples where the book doesn't provide proofs/explanations and hurries on to introduce new concepts.The first few chapters alone is definitely enough for you to understand the concepts of the later chapters, but you WILL need to read dedicated mathematics textbooks (like the ones they pointed out in the ""further readings"" sections at the end of each chapter) if you want to form a sound mathematical foundation.On the other hand, it did a decent job introducing many important algorithms in ML and the mathematics behind them, but it also lacks many key ideas important to ML. One would expect a book focusing on the mathematical side would be fairly theoretical on the subject of learning, but it doesn't cover fundamental theories in learning such as PAC learning, VC dimensions, No Free Lunch theorem, etc. I think the ""Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms"" book by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David is a much better read on those subjects.Overall, it's a good book to have, especially when you need to a quick refresher on the mathematics or needs some help understanding the mathematical intuitions behind popular ML algorithms. What the book is not, is a beginner-friendly machine learning textbook for those who don't already know some linear algebra.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Mathematics for Machine Learning
"I had been looking for a book to bridge the gap between implementing machine learning code on the granular level and understanding it from a theoretical perspective and the search wasn't going well. Lots of other books that I tried before finding this one promised to help programmers become better mathematicians (or at least show them the math they need to learn in order to achieve that goal) but would almost always just provide code without context, or run through some incredibly basic, introductory level math without explaining at all how it connects to the various machine learning algorithms you'll be implementing as a programmer.This book, however, takes the math seriously, and is incredibly direct and efficient in the introduction of new, relevant topics in calculus, linear algebra, and probability and statistics that you'll need to know if you want to truly understand the libraries you're using. I find myself reading a section in the book, going back to a ""dedicated"" textbook on the subject at hand - linear algebra or calculus or probability and statistics - and further studying the material, and then going back to Mathematics for Machine Learning to make sure I understand the topic better. This is the exact learning flow that I wanted, and the book delivers. Can't recommend enough!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mathematics for Machine Learning

"The title of this book is significantly misleading.  All the chapters cover Python basics, database interactions, Fast API, Pytest, etc...literally only the last chapter of the book discusses incorporating data science applications with Fast API.  Bad job by the author and publisher on choosing this title.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Building Data Science Applications with FastAPI: Develop, manage, and deploy efficient machine learning applications with Python"
"FastAPI is a relative newcomer as an API platform. However, because of its speed and ease of use, it has quickly become the favorite python package for API developers. It being a new platform, finding a good reference on FastAPI deployment in production environments, its integration with other systems like databases, containers etc. and industry best practices, were hard to come by. This is what this book excels at. There are 3 main takeaways from this book.1. The author has clearly explained even advanced concepts in simple terms using appropriate examples: Concepts like differences between ASGI and WSGI, asynchronous programming, CORS etc. are explained with the help of follow-along examples. This make grasping the concepts much easier compared with reading about their definitions online. Rather than just using certain techniques, the book also provides details on why and when should an approach be used.2. The book provides details on industry best practices: Having developed and deployed FastAPI applications myself, I can say that this book would be helpful to people who are just picking up FastAPI as their platform of choice. Easy to follow-along examples, with code hosted on Github, on end-to-end deployment using database backends and docker containers really make development a breeze. The book also talks in detail about unit tests, integration tests etc.  There is also good content on providing security, rate limits in the API.3. This book has easy to understand content for python beginners, for example, on how to effectively use classes and type hinting, as well as for seasoned programmers who, for example, wish to deploy a real-time face detection system using WebSockets and FastAPI.Hands down, this is perhaps the best resource for FastAPI as well as for API development frameworks in general.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Building Data Science Applications with FastAPI: Develop, manage, and deploy efficient machine learning applications with Python"
"When I first cracked open this text, I was skeptical of its usefulness.I'd been using fast api for over a year, on multiple projects, at multiple jobs, including a real-time recommendation system for scientific publications.Already being familiar with FastApi and it's documentation (which is fantastic, by the way), I didn't think this book could add much.When I got into section one, I was pleased with how the book was structured.It followed the structure of the Fastapi documentation in a linear fashion but everywhere the the documentation glossed by minor details, the author went deep into the surrounding technologies, underlying infrastructure and client protocols.Additionally the source code examples here are more continuous and less atomic than the documentation.The long chain of related example modules was hugely helpful in understanding how the modules of an API server come together.Section two continued with this trend, explaining the minutiae of related technologies.Subjects like types of databases, websockets, authorization headers, were presented thoroughly in a less coherent way.The level of detail on deeper topics like unit test parameterization, was still well beyond any docs or blogs, and helped me think through a problem I was considering that week at work.The closing chapter corrected course and explained the nuances of how to structure your api server for low IO needs.I expected topics that complex to be outside the scope of this book, and I was pleasantly surprised at their inclusion in the late sections.In conclusion, this book makes a thorough and helpful resource for web services with complex performance requirements.I'd recommend it highly to anyone working on ML engineering or an adjacent field.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Building Data Science Applications with FastAPI: Develop, manage, and deploy efficient machine learning applications with Python"

The author goes over many of the framework's capabilities, including its sophisticated dependency injection technique, as well as how to use it to interface with databases, establish authentication, and incorporate machine learning models into your application code. Security and best practices are two of my favorite parts of the process, yet they are also the most often disregarded.

"When Jeremy asked me to write a review for Minding the Machines, I was skeptical that I could do it.  My 2nd book, Building Analytics Teams, takes on the same topic.I enjoyed reading Minding the Machines.  The approach Jeremy takes in the book is more oriented to check lists and is a more left-brain oriented treatment of the topic.While Jeremy and I do not agree on all matters, especially the use of the Agile methodology in analytics, I found that there was significant commonality in our views on a number of subjects.If you are leaving college, or you are in a career transition to analytics, or if you are transitioning from an individual contributor role to a manager/leader, both our books can be useful for you in understanding your current role or your potential role in an analytics team.If you want a straightforward, list-oriented approach, buy Minding the Machines.If you are interested in a bit more right brained, creative approach, and want to read about real world examples of how to avoid pitfalls and manage toward success, Building Analytics Teams is probably more your style.

"As a ‘Career Transitioner’ into the field of data and analytics, I have found myself at times (mostly when I am in a room surrounded by senior analytic practitioners) questioning if the methodologies behind my analysis along with the skills from my past experiences, are good enough in today’s world of big data. When I first learned about Jeremy Adamson’s book, ‘Minding the Machines’ I was initially hesitant to pick it up; thinking that this book was purely for the data scientists of our world and not for someone as “green” as myself when it comes to analytics. I couldn’t have been more wrong. ‘Minding the Machines’ has become a valuable playbook with immeasurable insights that I reference daily. Not only does it provide a road-map to creating an analytics operation, it has become a book of validation for the work I do today and a guide on where I can improve tomorrow.The structure of the book is broken down almost like a check-list. From assessing the organizational readiness to building intentional relationships and cultivating a data-driven culture through trust, Jeremy Adamson shares his wealth of knowledge and experience in the AI and analytics realm.  In addition to learning how to build out a parsimonious analytics playbook, I’ve extended the teachings out of this book with both my own leaders and other stakeholders on the receiving end of data - where we can learn from Jeremy’s teaching on capability modeling, the pitfalls of change management, and how to further build out our collaboration effectiveness.This isn’t a “once and done” type of read. This is the type of book that you will continue to come back to and continually learn new ways to evolve the analytical principles not only for your business, but in yourself as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Minding the Machines: Building and Leading Data Science and Analytics Teams

"I'm a HUGE fan of the Heather Brothers' work, so I jumped on Chip Heath and Karla Starr's latest book, Making Numbers Count: The Art and Science of Communicating Numbers.  If you ever have to communicate the story behind the numbers on paper, a spreadsheet, or a PowerPoint slide, you need to read this book.  Why? Because it is more than the telling of the number or statistic.  The number(s) is important, but it's the understanding of the situation, the emotion it generates, and the feeling you are left with that really matters.As a professional speaker and panel moderator,  I have instinctively known this and mentioned the importance of making numbers count, but this book shows you HOW to do that.I love the fact that there are oodles of before/after comparative examples that are highlighted in green-colored boxes throughout the book.  The intent is that read the book, then flip through it, using those boxes as a springboard to your own creativity.So what kind of tips are we talking about?- Use small whole numbers. The easiest thing to process is whole numbers under 10, preferably 1 to 5.- Favor user-friendly numbers.  If you have to present bigger numbers, round it out so it's easier to mentally process the information.- Unless the audience deals in decimals all the time, convert the numbers to a whole number.- Fractions force people to do the math.  So do percentiles.  Instead, try the ""village of 100"" or ""basket of 100"" and convert those percentages into whole numbers.- Focus on the one:  Use something simple with a well-understood part of the overall scene: 1 employee, citizen, or student.  1 business, marriage, or classroom. 1 deal, game, or day.  Or focus on 1 concrete chunk of an experience: 1 prototypical visit, 1 day, 1 month in the quarter.- Comparisons help the listener understand the magnitude of a number relative to something they understand and appreciate.  Convert and compare it to a concrete object, recast it into time, space, distance, or money- Tie the number to a livid or emotional connection.As I was reading this book, I realized that it takes work, thoughtfulness, and creativity to express a number (or set of numbers) in a meaningful and memorable way.  This book is the spark to access that creativity.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Making Numbers Count: The Art and Science of Communicating Numbers

"This quote perfectly encapsulates the premise of the book:""When numbers come up, half of us say, “I’m a designer/teacher/lawyer, not a numbers person,” as if casting a spell to ward off a vampire. And the other half of us mumble apologies for the numbers and rush through our presentations before we slink back to our underworld lairs, where we can calculate in peace without facing scorn. Our claim is that we aren’t so different. If we simply translated our numbers differently, a lot more people would consider themselves numbers people.""-Chip Heath Currently, numbers tend to have an effect on most of us called ""psychophysical numbing.” Moving on the number scale from 10 to 20 feels significant.  But moving on from a scale of lets say...650 to 660 causes us to feel nothing, even though the increase is the same (this is numbing).  The goal of the book is to kill off this ""numbing"" by making numbers come alive in our minds.The author provides a number of interesting ways to do this that i can honestly go on about.  1. Using landmarks (like we do with maps...instead of learning the whole map we rely on landmarks to provide us with the gist of things).2. Using analogies3. Using emotional stories to bring out the story behind said statistic.4. Using concrete translations make things recognizable. Ex: Tumor size Explanation 1 cm pea 2 cm peanut.I can go on and on but you get the point, the book essentially provides a number of tools that make numbers more approachable.The book also provides various examples of these ideas in use, I like how Chip also goes out of his way to show us how people would normally present said statistic and then shows us how it looks when said tool/translation is applied to it.Honestly, this is a book I wish I read back in college...maybe I would have at least minored in a math-based field.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Making Numbers Count: The Art and Science of Communicating Numbers

"I have bought this book as soon as it was published with great enthusiasm and anticipation. Unfortunately, after reading the first chapter on Fundamentals I am sorely disappointed. The didactic value of this chapter is non-existent. Even if the first version of this chapter might have been consistent and with some guiding thought, it truly seems like the author has decided to cut the individual paragraphs and paste them back in random order! To illustrate quantum indeterminacy, perhaps? For example, terms ""hermitian"" and ""unitary"" are used _before_ they are defined! The phase aspect of Bloch sphere is not explained at all leaving the reader wondering why do we need to bother with it at all. What does it mean that the ""H is separable"" (H being the Hilbert space)? Not explained at all!And the item that elevated my frustration to the point of triggering this review was formula for the Grover operator (equation 1.38 on page 27, also attached as an image). Grover's Algorithm is an important first illustration of quantum computing and a key to its understanding. Similarly, the Grover operator is the core item without which the understanding of Grover's Algorithm falls apart. And how does the equation 1.38 define it? Let me copy the image in text format:G = (2|psi><psi|-I)OAlthough the first factor is perfectly understandable, the ""O"" (second factor) is nowhere defined - not before, and not after! What is this funny ""O""? The reader is left in a superposition of frustration and disgust. :(Save your money, there are better books on quantum computing out there.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Quantum Machine Learning: An Applied Approach: The Theory and Application of Quantum Machine Learning in Science and Industry
"Great book, very timely and long awaited,  filling a huge gap in the filed of quantum ML. The author goes through the first 3 chapters addressing fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics and classical Machine Learning with hands-on examples. Then gets into the details of a subject that is possibly the hardest deep tech till to date. And he does it not just theoretically but also with codes, explained (phew). This is also the only book I have come across which takes on programming of D-Wave platforms (and also Xanadu) and spends at least two chapters on it.Highly recommended for anyone trying to get their heads around QML, given the disparity in platforms ( superconductivity, photonics, annealing...). This is a book written by a professional and researcher for others like him - 550+ pages of total dedication to the subject. I look forward to a second edition with codes updated (Google Cirq+Rigetti etc.)To the reviewer who have accused the author of not explaining stuff and especially the ""O"" in Grover's algorithm: He actually has explained it, it great details in Chapter 1, page 25 onward before that equation is quoted. That ""O"" is order of complexity. Please see the attached screen shot . This is not a subject one can shovel through in a hurry, requires a lot of patience, diligence and dedication.This book is NOT for people who wants to be spoon-fed information and not a book for Beginners in Quantum COMPUTING but for Quantum MACHINE LEARNING ( hence, some prerequisites and research mind-sets are required). Readers should know the difference between the two subjects. People wanting to get into Quantum COMPUTING should look at books meant for them, such as David McMahon, Jack Hidary or several other such books that are out there today. Then after you are done with those, pick up this one.this book,as it clearly states at the back, is for ""Intermediate to Advanced"" readers, not for newbies. Requires some fundamental knowledge of math, QM and QC, whereas basics of classical ML is explained very nicely in Chapters 2 and 3 with coding examples.I bought the book off the publisher's website, not Amazon.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Quantum Machine Learning: An Applied Approach: The Theory and Application of Quantum Machine Learning in Science and Industry

"The author of this book has established a great reputation for himself as a shrewd investor and the founder of a successful and storied hedge fund. Bridgewater Associates has attracted the best and the brightest. Intellectual honesty, rigor and reportedly brutal candor are hallmarks of the firm. All which makes this book eagerly anticipated.And yet, this reader found the tome surprising for its lack of honesty. Worse, given the non-disclosure of at least one big fact, the work could be characterized as self-serving. Or, like war, is this book perhaps all about deception?Nowhere in the tome is there reference to Bridgewater Associates’ $1.25 billion raise for its third investment fund in China, as reported in the Wall Street Journal on November 24, 2021. This, to quote the Journal, would “catapult[s] the hedge-fund firm into the ranks of the biggest foreign managers of private funds in the world’s second-largest economy”. The book was released November 30, 2021. Was the author aware of the fund’s placement before he published? Would it affect the reader’s treatment of his subject-matter? One could guess ‘probably’ on the former and ‘certainly’ on the latter. The author’s work is his own, but he writes “[t]he people and tools at Bridgewater were also invaluable to this research.”As to honesty, let’s look at the testy issue of intellectual property – long seen as something at issue in US-China relations. While acknowledging “intellectual property” is a thing, the author devotes merely 6 references to intellectual property in the book. Six! One of them is about Americans stealing Chinese IP. Yet buried in a footnote is a CNBC Global CFO Survey that finds 20% of CFOs report to having had IP stolen by Chinese companies. To add insult to all innovators out there, the author contends that, you know, stealing IP has been going on, like, forever: “Stealing intellectual property has been going on for as long as there has been recorded history and has always been difficult to prevent”.Wow.Beyond the honesty, there’s just plain sloppy writing. Mr. Dalio may want to add a forceful editor to ‘triangulate’ with, to use his term for seeking counsel of notables. Consider this abominably ugly sentence, upon which a Kindle refund ought to issue:“For example, it is because of the United States’ great global successes that the US dollar became the world’s dominant reserve currency, which allowed Americans to borrow excessively from the rest of the world (including from China), which put the US in the tenuous position of owing other countries (including China) a lot of money which has put those other countries in the tenuous position of holding the debt of an overly indebted country that is rapidly increasing and monetizing its debt and that pays significantly negative real interest rates to those holding its debt.""One could go on. The rule of law, treatment of human rights, appropriation of private property, freedoms of speech, religion, assembly, climate change... All of these weighty themes are curiously absent in a true discussion of the author’s putative Ruler Of The World In Waiting.But what about insight on stuff the author knows a great deal? Money, central banks, reserve currencies and their role, historically in global growth and order? This is the stuff one could reasonably give Mr. Dalio a very high degree of competence. Well, here too the ball is dropped, hard. There was a lot of discussion here, but the discussion seemed frozen in 1990. There was materially zero discussion on arguably some of the tectonic shifts in history coming our way – some of which may truly change the world order. For example, how are Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and sovereignty-agnostic crypto to change the very nature of money itself? Or the world order therein? You don’t have to be a crypto bull to argue that digitization of fiat currencies is a Thing. That. Merits. Discussion. Yet here too, zero. Perhaps it was too sensitive for the audience in Beijing, given their own CBDC initiatives.A nit now, perhaps. But there are a lot of ugly meaningless charts. My candidate for indictment is the bell curve chart (reproduced in the photo attached to this review). It depicts two nations’ relative position of dominance in the world – the USA and China. The bell curve has ‘The Top’ at the peak and the label “CHN -> The Rise” on the ascendant curve, and “USA -> The Decline” on its descendant.  Would a sentence like “China is on the rise to the top, while the US is declining past its peak” do instead? And isn’t that really the only chart that Mr. Dalio wanted to impart in the whole book, given the audience in Beijing and the Bridgewater investment in China? More to the point, should we just have dispensed with all the charts and words and ‘triangulation’ and dinner parties with Lee Kuan Yew and paid our $16.99 for a Kindle version of that sentence?So to the reader-to-be, my advice is simply this. Save your money. The only real point is Mr. Dalio’s contention that China is on the ascendant slope, and the USA is past its prime. Because that is a message that resonates well with readers in Beijing, where he is wanting to be seen as playing nice.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail
"It is a really good collection of Mr. Dahlio's thoughs on what will happen next. It also leads me to believe that some of Bridgewater's bets will not be paying off in the next 3-5-10 years, specifically related to China.It is a very interesting read and he does a solid job of explaining the economic history of the last thousand years. I do have 2 gripes with the narrative he creates. One is that its like Xi Jin Ping himself paid Ray to write this- he gushes over China and its people and policies for like a quarter of the book, while brushing past genocide and oppression. He just beats you over the head with it. The second and more important gripe is that he writes a 500 page book about economic change and does not once address population change as a factor driving growth (or lack thereof). Like...it's such a glaring omission that it casts doubt on the rest of the book. How, as an editor, do you not point this out to him? If you're going to read this book, follow it up with Peter Zeitan's The End of the World is Just the Beginning.If you can read the book as a supplement towards your knowledge of economic and political change (as opposed to a comprehensive guide) then its a really interesting read.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail
"In this book, Dalio presents his model of the rise and fall of ""empires"". The closer it gets to the present day the more interesting the book is. The last three chapters of the book which deal with the rise of China, the current tensions between China and the US, the United States's alleged decline and Dalio's conjectures regarding the future are five stars. The build up to the final three chapters is decent, although only occasionally riveting: The book is only three stars before the strong close.It is hard to evaluate the merits of Dalio's historical model given that he is only presenting it at moderate depths so as to introduce it all in one volume. The model says that empires rise and fall, no surprise, and talks about the interplay of economic, internal, and external factors that take an empire through the cycle. Dalio also mentions that inside the Big Cycle there are other cycles, and inside those cycles other cycles. He does not, however, go into much detail regarding the sub-cycles. This sounds reminiscent of Robert Prechter's Elliot Waves or perhaps, even, pre-Copernican astrology. Is this a model so loose, like Elliot Waves, that it can be found to fit anything that could happen? Is it falsifiable? Along the way was the validity tested by approaching an empire that there was little prior knowledge of to make ""forward predictions"" regarding what would happen? Has Dalio merely cherry picked the three examples which best seem to demonstrate the soundness of the model while omitting more problematic cases? There is not enough in this book to do a rigorous analysis.The United States Civil War is a good example of something I had trouble thinking about in terms of the model. According to the model the final stage in an empire's breakdown is civil war or revolution. In the case of the United States, however, the Civil War occurred while the United States was still ascendant: in stage 2 out of 6 with stage 3 being the peak. Certainly there was no debt crisis which caused the Civil War and the United States had little going on in terms of external conflict at the time. So perhaps that could have been taken as a ""prediction"" that the United States would almost certainly have survived the Civil War in tact? The truth, however, is that the South came very close to winning the Civil War, in the sense of being recognized as independent, according to McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom.Another thing that I am not sure how to evaluate using the model is the United States after the Civil War and after the Revolution. Although these were periods of rebuilding they do not seem to fit well into Dalio's model. After victory in these conflicts Americans were very magnanimous (as it was later after World War II). Far from being purged those who were on the wrong side of history ended up facing rather little in the way of consequences. So how does this fit into the model? Obviously, there will be some ""rebuilding"" after a Revolution or Civil War so is the model just saying there will be something which could not not happen? Indeed although the United States was vibrant after the Revolution, the period after the Civil War as described in Richard White's The Republic for Which it Standards seems in decline compared to the Antebellum period. According to Dalio's model, however, the United States was stage 2 rising into stage 3 during this period.Regardless of the merits of the model, which would probably require many in depth books to evaluate fully, there is definitely some good high level overviews of Chinese, European, and American history. There are many interesting charts and statistics thrown in.As mentioned, the close of the book is far and away the best part of it. Dalio describes the cultural differences between Americans and Chinese people and their different outlooks toward governing. Dalio does not seem to be pushing any political agenda, at least not too hard, but rather what he has carefully measured to be objectively true. Although clearly an admirer of much about China, he is also willing to criticize some aspects of China. At the same time, his criticism omits its surveillance state.Looking forward Dalio presents some very interesting charts and statistics regarding America's growing internal conflicts. He even has a graph to show how bad it is now compared to early points in history. Dalio is willing to stick his neck out and quantify what his model is predicting as the probability of civil war in the United States and the probability of military war with China in the next decade.Although very thought provoking overall, one particularly persistent problem throughout the book is that many of the charts are very hard to read. There are graphs with eight different lines with some of the colors very hard to distinguish between. The book also almost never references its sources. Indeed, given how much history Dalio has obviously studied, a bibliography, or at least a list of recommendations, would be very nice.Dalio is very repetitive regarding the inevitable death of fiat currencies through money printing. At the same time he also does provide concrete advise of how to prepare. He gives some definite timelines and the dates are very close. To qualify this, somewhat, however, his company Bridgewater Associates has basically had a ""lost decade"" using his models to generate any kinds of returns since his departure around 2012. Nevertheless it is interesting to think about whether or the US is on the verge of multiple simultaneous crises.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail
"Ray put into a book many of the thoughts I've been considering and trying to communicate to my friends. We need to step back and see the big picture, see a larger time frame.  Trusting that the world will always be like what you have experienced during your adult life is naive.Pull your head out of the sand, think about what is going on in the world.  Ray may be one of the best resources for understanding many of these concepts focusing on financial aspects and national trends.  Every empire before has always fallen, there is absolutely no reason to believe the USA won't also decline.  And if you study it you'll realize the USA has already been in decline for decades.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail
"Dalio has a unique perspective on the topic of the changing world order. He is a successful businessman who has spent his career analyzing economic trends and patterns, and this book is a culmination of his findings. His writing is clear and concise, making complex economic concepts easy to understand.One of the best features of the book is its organization. The book is broken down into 14 chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of the changing world order. Dalio starts with the big picture, examining the major forces driving the changing world order, before delving into the specifics of each major empire, including the Dutch, British, American, Chinese, Soviet, and Japanese empires. Ultimately, he brings everything full circle by discussing the changing world order today and what the future may hold.Another great aspect of the book is the way that Dalio weaves history and economics together. He doesn't just present economic theories in a vacuum; he uses real-world examples to show how they have played out over time. For example, in Chapter 5, he discusses the Great Depression and how it shaped the changing world order in the 1930s and 1940s. He also uses the rise of populism in Chapter 7 to illustrate how economic inequality can lead to political instability.Overall, I would highly recommend ""The Changing World Order"" to any intelligent human interested in economics, history, or politics. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the forces shaping our world today and what the future may hold. As Dalio himself puts it, ""understanding how the world works is essential if you want to accomplish your goals and live a fulfilling life.""Here are some key takeaways from the book:The changing world order is driven by three major forces: the changing relative powers of countries, the changing relative productivity of countries, and the changing values of countries.The rise and fall of empires is a natural part of the changing world order. Each empire has its own unique characteristics, but they all follow a similar pattern of rise, peak, and decline.The post-World War II order was built on the idea of free trade and cooperation between nations. However, this order is now under threat due to rising nationalism and protectionism.China is currently on the rise and is likely to become the world's dominant economic power in the coming decades. However, although this rise is not guaranteed, and there are many challenges that China will need to overcome, the US needs to step up its game on several fronts to compete.The future of the world order is uncertain, but there are a few things we can say with some degree of certainty. For example, the rise of automation and artificial intelligence is a hot topic today likely to have a major impact on the global economy in the coming years.Overall, ""The Changing World Order"" is a well-written and informative book that is sure to appeal to a wide range of readers. Whether you're a history buff, an economics nerd, or just someone who wants to better understand the world we live in, this book is well worth your time.

As a visualization researcher, it's enlightening to see the breadth and depth of knowledge presented here. It's a must-have resource for those looking to learn more about data visualization.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Functional Aesthetics for Data Visualization
"My data visualization library contains many books authored by and geared toward data practitioners. Many good books. But Functional Aesthetics for Data Visualization is the first I’ve read that combines theory, research, and practice into its singular vision of data visualization as a medium yet remains accessible to a more general audience.It's a refreshingly different dataviz text. Integral to what makes it different from other books is the synthesis of perspectives of two women with very different backgrounds--Bridget Cogley was an American Sign Language interpreter prior to her data career, and Vidya Setlur is a researcher particularly interested in natural language processing (NLP). The give and take between perspectives makes the book read like a conversation.The material presented, particularly in later chapters, is complex, but the method and order of presentation makes it easily consumable. Since it is, in fact, a book about visual communication, it’s unsurprising that there are visual cues in the book. What’s remarkable is the effectiveness of the choices of subtle visual cues. They gently guide you through the material, making sure you’re following the conversation. The bottom of each page is bordered with one of four colors each mapped to one of the four parts of the text–Perception, Semantics, Intent, and Putting It All Together. Next to each important concept, there’s a rounded rectangle with some explanatory text and an accompanying triangle with the word “research” at one point, and “practice” and “theory” at the other two points, respectively. There is a circle inside the triangle, placed to orient the reader to where the concept is currently situated in the landscape of the field of data visualization.You’re not getting any freebies from Bridget Cogley and Vidya Setlur. No new “best” practices, no “nevers” or “always”, no five easy steps to he perfect dashboard. This book makes no assumptions about your profession, your industry, or your opinion about pie charts. In fact, the only assumption it makes is that you’re a human who can read or be read to. For those of us who are practitioners, Functional Aesthetics challenges us to not only follow the conversation contained within, but to continue it. It subtly nudges us to engage in a conversation between ourselves as creators of data visualizations, our established processes, our assumptions, and our workflows. I took my time reading it because each section left me wanting time to integrate and experiment with some of the ideas in my own visualizations and to re-examine my long-held notions of the “right” ways to approach dataviz.If you’re new to data visualization, I can’t think of a better book to start with. If you’re a long-time practitioner, Functional Aesthetics will freshen your perspective, leaving you excited to approach your next viz with a beginner’s mind. Everyone’s needs are considered here, and all are invited to the conversation.Many, if not most, data visualization books focus on the data visualization creator's perspective and goals for their work almost exclusively. This emphasis on the practitioner’s goals is not wrong and doesn’t mean that the user, viewer, or audience is excluded. They’re very much top of mind–as a consumer of what the practitioner wants to serve up, in terms of both graphs and insights. Considerations about the user’s goals with respect to interaction with data visualizations are mostly limited to cases where the user is a business person consuming a business data visualization (""dashboard"").Business stakeholders occupy little space in Functional Aesthetics for Data Visualization, except as users of visualizations like any other user. We now live in a world where we all look at charts and graphs for a variety of reasons. Functional Aesthetics is very much a book for chart creators, but also for chart consumers who might be curious about how charts work and want to increase their level of graphicacy (chart literacy).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Functional Aesthetics for Data Visualization
Very Informative!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Functional Aesthetics for Data Visualization
"Functional aesthetics for data visualization? That's working well and looking good, I take it. Many visualizations do poorly on one or other score, and so guidance towards reaching those goals is always welcome. Here the broad aim is ""semantically resonant data-centric creations"" (p.xviii). Good visualizations give good vibrations?This book seems most aimed at, and most suitable for, people whohave already read several books on visualization, and especially have some experience of the fieldhave as their main responsibility preparing visualizations for others, say in a business, consultancy, non-profit or government support roleare using Tableau or something similar (although there is no specific detail on software use, mentions of Tableau dominate; on p.285 departure from Tableau defaults without a strategy is flagged as a possible problem)are most interested in dashboards (composite visualizations with two or more graphs or maps, often contrasting, and perhaps some text too; students and academics in many fields are more likely to think in terms of posters)are working with fairly simple graphs and maps, such as bar or line charts or dot or patch maps (and so using basic statistical or cartographic methods).As a teacher and researcher in a university with a long-term interest in statistical graphics (data and information visualization too), I fit the first criterion well, but most of the others barely or not at all. That kind of misfit isn't crucial: the book might be interesting or useful far beyond its most obvious target readership. But see how far you match that little list.As indications of what is not here, as well as what is: There is no recognition that many, indeed I suspect most, visualizations are devised in spreadsheets such as MS Excel, presentation software such as MS PowerPoint, or statistical and GIS software. The statistical level is shown by the authors twice alluding (pp.144, 270) to box plots as more advanced, which will surprise students meeting them in a first statistics course. Logarithmic scale appears briefly on p.62. To be clear, I am all for simple methods when they suffice, but be advised accordingly.The authors' tone is informal and friendly. Generous acknowledgments include affectionate mentions of one dog and three cats. Their expertise and enthusiasm are evident. But I found their writing often hard to follow. I had to read many sentences twice. Sometimes my puzzle was whether I was missing a nuance wrapped up in a very simple statement that seemed too obvious. Sometimes I had to disentangle the message from jargon, metaphor, or analogy. Sometimes the problem was just awkward or cryptic writing.Technical writing often raises tensions between authors who use terminology that you are expected to know or to be willing to learn and readers who struggle with what may seem unfamiliar or unnecessary jargon. My concern here is that the authors' style varies so much, as purple patches are mixed with much that is clear and even vivid. As so often happens, they have been let down by their publishers. Copy editing should have fixed many of the small problems I had, and fixed many awkward sentences using parallel constructions. Uses of both ... and ..., either ... or ..., and not only ... but also ... often need to be read twice too. Copy editing should have hacked at the paradigms, parameters and ecosystems mentioned again and again, all those words being stretched way beyond their customary meaning. It should have found simpler alternatives for de-emphasize and deduplicating.Some outright errors, most but not all trivial:  Ansel Adam on p.1 should be Adams. The reference to astrology on p.38 looks like a slip for astronomy, although I can't guess at what is meant by the reference to cryptology on p.39. On p.41 Fisher's T test is presumably Student's t test, an error that compounds a profoundly unhistorical aside. The Mercator projection used on p.177 is utterly inappropriate as exaggerating areas in polar latitudes as compared with the tropics.Despite some informality, this is mostly a serious and fairly academic book. Make sure that you note from p.xxii that references are to be found on the publishers' website, a puzzling and inconvenient arrangement. The authors want to tell you about the present frontier in data visualization, including their own work. Sections on research using artificial intelligence, and in particular natural language processing, are among the most intriguing contributions, although little is ever discussed in any real detail or depth. Typically there is an allusive paragraph, then a reference or two, and then we move on.In a book on visualization, almost everything stands or falls on the graphics themselves. Graphics here divide about half and half into two groups. There are direct examples of visualizations showing data or results of analysis. There are also various supporting images. The latter include many triangle icons in which the current focus is plotted in terms of addressing research, practice, theory or a mix. Sorry, but I didn't find these helpful. There are some splendid photos of landscapes and food (no spoiler from me explaining why). The visualizations themselves are often unreadable in detail, although that isn't always crucial to the points being made.My biggest surprise I leave to last. Although it wouldn't be his wording at all, functional aesthetics is a major theme running through Edward Tufte's first book on graphics, ""The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"", published originally 40 years ago, and four sequels to date. It doesn't rate even a mention here, but Tufte's work could be a far better starting point for anyone interested in the themes raised in this book.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Functional Aesthetics for Data Visualization

"Worthless -- Utterly useless.  All examples are oversimplified generalities.  The method the author uses to approach the ""4th Industrial Revolution"" is nothing new, but rather just a regurgitation of identify the problem, determine whether solving it is worth the effort, magically solve the problem, implement the magic solution and evaluate.  Yawn.  Worse because it's tedious as he just says the same thing over and over.  There is no discussion on how to strategically approach data collection, just understand what you have and maybe look to get more -- nothing insightful.

"In my years as an IT Consultant, it was often a difficult task to provide information on a new technology to the multiple roles necessary in its successful development; and in a startup where a small team acts as everything from project manager to product leadership to software and hardware development roles this is particularly relevant, and this book fulfills all these needs to perfection.  Edge AI is an extreme example of this sort of technology embodying both software, algorithm development, embedded hardware and electronics, as well as management lifecycle and product marketing roles.  These expert developers: Daniel Situnayake and Jenny Plunkett both principals at Edge Impulse provide excellent direction which can be absorbed at all stages of this promising yet precarious development lifecycle.This book gives general background and instruction on what is Edge AI and Machine Learning providing clear explanations that can be grasped by less technical managers, as well as a detailed picture of what is necessary to create a realistic and successful development project that corresponds to a variety of use cases.  The book is roughly divided into three relatively independent yet complete sections, first a tutorial on the definitions, lifecycle and caveats of successful embedded AI development, secondly a detailed but not overly complicated section provided the specifics of a successful implementation and the development and engineering issues involved (this is the largest section in the book), and finally 3 widely divergent use cases involving wildlife conservation, food safety, and a consumer product giving sufficient detail to insure successful implementation of similar and dissimilar products.While this is not primarily a software implementation book sufficient detail is provided for the Edge Impulse ML/Ops framework to allow successful end to end development with a variety of tools.This is one of the best books I have seen in over forty years as an IT consultant in introducing and successfully implementing a new technology.--Ira LaefskyMS Engineering UPenn/ Wharton MBA formerly on the Computer Consulting Staff of Arthur D.

"I felt kind of ripped off when I first opened this.  It's Xerox quality printing wrapped in a nice printed cover.  At the time I ordered it, it said “Only 1 left in stock - order soon.”  A few days later, it still says that now.  Perhaps they print and bind these as needed.  Mainly though, I had misjudged the intended audience.  When I realized the intended audience, and the author's effort to make stats more hands on and there fore hopefully accessible, I have to acknowledge this may be a win.This is actually a book for maybe Seniors in high school and definitely Sophomore/Freshman in college.  The description of the phrase “resampling” takes three pages and involves muddy photos of someone drawing numbers out of a hat.  Chapter 8.3, about 3/5 of the way through the book is entitled “Understanding confidence intervals.”  (after regression)  So this is a book for beginners.  I hate foggy questions in textbooks so when it asks “What is the chief difference between a bootstrap distribution and a sampling distribution?” ..  I can just imagine students giving a good answer that gets marked down because it doesn’t reflect that instructor’s language in the course.  Conceptually these are chasing the same purpose and that’s what you want kids to know.When you realize this book is intended as a first adventure in basic statistics and R, however, you have to give it some credit.  It covers a basic smattering of the things they will actually encounter in the field.  Graphics are covered and there’s a section on drawing histograms with GGPlot.  There’s some tidyverse stuff.  Courses used to push more theory before going into regression, but these folks jump right into it.  That's probably a good call given how prevalent regression is nowadays.  It's a little scary since these machines can run off the rails, but it does make stats more real.  Throughout the book there's a back and forth focus between learning to code and learning to ""stat."" From what I saw skimming it, it seems to have a good balance in that regard.  They take a little time to help you learn data wrangling, so you're not totally lost when you move on to apply it somewhere and that's a good call.The 32 pages on sampling only have one page devoted to the central limit theorem at the end, but throughout that chapter, you’ve been doing hands on stuff about pulling samples to get the feel of this essential concept.  And I guess that’s the thing which stands out.  They use simple language, to draw you into the objectives and things we care about when we apply the tools of statistics.  For a given audience, that in itself is priceless.So, while it wasn’t at all what I thought it would be, and I know better than to buy something with the word “Modern” in the title, this does seem to be a refreshing approach for making statistics relevant and real to people as they are first initiated to this field.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse (Chapman & Hall/CRC The R Series)

"Stats is hard to learn and most introductory courses and books aren't good at teaching it.  As a data scientist it's taken me many years to understand it.  I have taken it as an undergraduate, taken it as a graduate student, and audited a class taught by a friend.  I have several books on introductory stats, introductory data science, introductory stats with R, etc.I could have skipped a HUGE amount of that effort had I had this a decade ago!  The authors clearly have experience with stats and with the challenges students face in learning it.  Rather than simply teach statistical theory, book starts with the practical process for exploring and analyzing data.  It then implements that process with simulation based statistics explained with practical examples readers could potentially repeat at home.  Finally, how to do all the calculations including a modern (tidyverse) process is shown step by step.Just that would be enough to make this the go to stats 101 book, but it goes beyond.  The book is written at an incredibly accessible level.  The book regularly repeats and references itself, helping ensure readers learn the statistics terms within rather than being confused as the term is only defined once and repeatedly used without re-definition, (a common occurrence in other books and classes).  It provides multiple practical examples at each step.  It even provides theory-based frequentist examples to help people understand the relationship between such theory based approaches and the main simulation based approach.  I can say I better understand theory-based statistics now, even though I focus on simulation-based statistics.Finally, the authors have created excellent tools to go along with the book. the `infer` Rstats package in particular provides a simple and clear way for readers to take what they've learned and implement statistics in the their own tasks.  The package is designed to enforce statistics concepts simply through it's process so that the effect of the book will live far beyond reading it.All in all, this is the stats book everyone should start with.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse (Chapman & Hall/CRC The R Series)
"I got into this book primarily to beef up my R and Tidyverse skills - and the book delivers. It's a very solid introduction to exploratory data analysis. Statistics education should be very closely intertwined with what a data scientist / analyst does day-to-day which is data wrangling and preparing for further analysis.Emphasizing the Tidyverse upfront for quick wins was a smart choice by the authors. Anyone who has used ggplot2 can attest to its visualizations capabilities over a point-and-click GUI like SPSS.The book simplifies the various statistical tests possible by presenting it under the general linear model focusing on regression, with the implication that t-tests and ANOVA are special cases. The ModernDive and Infer packages, of which the authors have developed and use extensively in the text, significantly streamline bootstrap re-sampling and subsequent creation and visualization of confidence intervals (and p-values). I appreciated the equal airtime for confidence intervals given the known problems around p-hacking.Sampling, Bootstrapping and Confidence Intervals are where the book really shines as it introduces simulations available with a statistical programming lang like R - - this was simply not available my first go around with SPSS.In the next edition, I'm hoping for an expanded discussion of trade-offs, if any, between re-sampling with vs without replacement and a discussion of bootstrapping strategies within the context of other sampling methodologies.All in all, I think this should be everyone's first course in statistical inference.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse (Chapman & Hall/CRC The R Series)

"I found this book to be a great resource for reference, although I'm not sure it's for people completely lacking statistical or machine learning knowledge.  The author references ML terms quite early on without really explaining what they are.However, in my case, I was using this book to jog my memory of concepts I'd learned but forgotten in college.  I majored in stats, with a focus in ML, then spent 2 years doing front end development.  Now I'm going back to machine learning, and this book is the perfect, short and sweet summary of the terms and concepts needed to understand everything at a high level.It's a great reference to have on your bookshelf - especially to remind yourself quickly or a term, or if you're trying to compare and decide on what algorithm you need to use for a new dataset.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Machine Learning For Absolute Beginners: A Plain English Introduction (Second Edition) (AI, Data Science, Python & Statistics for Beginners Book 3)"

"Vershynin's book covers a set of topics that is likely to become central in the education for ""modern"" mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, and (electrical) engineers. He discusses ideas, techniques, and tools that arise across fields, and he conceptually unifies them under the brand name of ""high-dimensional probability"".His choice of topics (e.g., concentration/deviation inequalities, random vectors/matrices, stochastic processes, etc.) and applications (e.g., sparse recovery, dimension-reduction, covariance estimation, optimization bounds, etc.) delivers a necessary (and timely) addition to the growing body of data-science-related literature—more on this below.Vershynin writes in a conversational, reader-friendly manner. He weaves theorems, lemmas, corollaries, and proofs into his dialogue with the reader without getting caught in an endless theorem-proof loop. In addition, the book's integrated exercises and its prompts to ""check!"" or think about ""why?"" are strong components of the book. My copy of the book is already full of notes to myself where I’m “checking” something or explaining “why” something is true/false. (Also, as an aside, I love that coffee cups are used to signal the difficulty of a problem—good style.)I want to highlight a few examples where Vershynin’s choice of topics and his prose shine brightly. In section 4.4.1, he guides us through an example that clearly illustrates the usefulness of ε-nets for bounding matrix norms. I’d seen ε-nets and covering numbers before, but never had good intuition for why they showed up in a proof.Similarly, I’d struggled to gain intuition about why/how Gaussian widths and Vapnik–Chervonekis dimension capture/measure the complexity of a set. After reading sections 7.5 and 8.3 and working through some exercises, the two concepts are much clearer. Moreover, Vershynin connects these ideas back to covering numbers, which helped me better my understanding of all three concepts.Finally, I found the discussions on chaining and generic chaining in chapter 8 to be excellent. Following them up with Talagrand’s comparison inequality, which becomes the hammer of choice for the matrix deviation inequality (in chapter 9), rounds out a long, but very valuable/useful chapter—and one that I’ll certainly re-study and reference.I would recommend this book for those interested in (high-dimensional) statistics, randomized numerical linear algebra, and electrical engineering (particularly, signal processing). As I'm coming to realize, the ""concentration of measure"" and “deviation inequality” toolbox is essential to these areas. Lastly, I believe that this book makes a great companion to “Concentration Inequalities” by Boucheron, Lugosi, Massart.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"High-Dimensional Probability: An Introduction with Applications in Data Science (Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics, Series Number 47)"

"This book review was not written by ChatGPT or any other bot. Apparently, that may be getting increasingly rare.Just in time for the holiday season, the three wise men from the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management (Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb) brought us a treasure trove of insight and analysis about AI adoption and the transformative impact it will likely have on companies, industries, hospitals, governments, and more.“Power and Prediction: The Disruptive Economics of Artificial Intelligence” picks up where the trio’s 2018 bestseller  “Prediction Machines” left off. It’s absolutely worth a read for business leaders and others who are interested in how AI will likely impact our economies and societies in the coming years.One reason to read Chapter 1: You’ll learn a useful framework for how AI may go about reconstructing companies and industries in very similar ways to how harnessing electricity led to reconstructed companies and industries.Nugget #1: “Our task here is to light your way to anticipate who may gain and who may lose power as AI systems develop and are adopted.”One reason to read Chapter 2: You’ll orient yourself in what the authors refer to as “The Between Times.” AI’s here, but it’s still viewed by many as niche and has barely scratched the surface in terms of how impactful it may well be in the reasonably near future.Nugget #2: “AI prediction is already having a system change effect in the innovation process.”One reason to read Chapter 3: You’ll learn what kinds of companies tend be the most successful early adopters of AI technology and why.Nugget #3: “The enemy will go beyond the training data, and peacetime data will be of little use.”One reason to read Chapter 4: You’ll gain an understanding of how and why AI offers much more value to organizations that have a lot of decisions to make (in real time) versus organizations that are mostly run according to standardized “rules” (i.e., pre-loaded decisions).Nugget #4: “The function of AI is to provide better prediction, which essentially means that you have the information you need to make better decisions.”One reason to read Chapter 5: You’ll never think about airports in the same way again.Nugget #5:”If your business is to provide a way to help people when they wait for a plane, what’s the chance you are going to ensure that they don’t have to wait for planes?”One reason to read Chapter 6: You’ll be exposed to some of the ways in which AI can turbocharge personalization in both advertising and education.Nugget #6: “The most profitable aspect of the AI would be to ratchet up advertising to customers who were on the fence between the free and the paid versions.”One reason to read Chapter 7: You’ll see how a system that has too many rules may be too slow to implement predictive tools that would make the system more effective.Nugget #7: “A new system may be so disruptive that you may need to start using it in a new organization, where it can grow organically, rather than trying to adapt to it in existing organizations.”One reason to read Chapter 8:While people tend to think about potential cost savings from AI, more sophisticated players (such as some of the biggest tech companies) focus more on the value that AI can unleash.Nugget #8: ”Chatbots are playing a bigger role in customer service, and machine translation is getting an increased share of that activity.”One reason to read Chapter 9: You’ll see how automation of hypothesis generation might lead to enormous advances in medical research and recommendation-engine development.Nugget #9: “If we had to point to an area where AI has the most potential for transforming the economy, it is well upstream from most ordinary business activities: in the system of innovation and invention.”One reason to read Chapter 10: There’s a great discussion riffing on the theme that top-down innovation is much more dangerous to incumbents than is bottom-up disruption. Bottom-up disruption is much easier for incumbents to co-opt.Nugget #10: “The Blockbuster case is, of course, a dramatic example of both the failure to change in the face of a new technology and also how internal forces prevented that change before it was too late.”One reason to read Chapter 11: AI doesn’t make decisions, but – as AI becomes more and more sophisticated – it sure looks like it’s making decisions. You’ll become more sophisticated in understanding where decisions are actually made in different systems.Nugget #11: “What Amazon was doing was measuring worker performance, using an AI to evaluate whether that performance was a cause for concern, and then having a human manager decide what to do.”One reason to read Chapter 12: You’ll read about how early access to feedback data can give first movers on AI a possibly insurmountable advantage. Organizations that wait to adopt AI will face higher and higher barriers to entry as we go through time.Nugget #12: “Learning comes from data, and so first-mover advantage comes from a feedback loop in that data.”One reason to read Chapter 13: I’ve got to admit that I wasn’t necessarily expecting to read about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. But it is a memorable example of how judgment is affected when prediction is decoupled from judgment. A variation on that theme begins with Vinod Khosla’s conjecture about potential interplay between AI, radiology, and litigation.Nugget #13: “In the end, [Michael] Jordan ‘took the pill” and got back in the game, albeit with significant time restrictions that[Jerry] Reinsdorf imposed.”One reason to read Chapter 14: As multiple systems transition from deterministic to probabilistic, missing data means uncertainty, and we can expect to see enormous impacts in everything from self-driving cars to international law interpretation and enforcement. It’s more and more about “thinking in bets” as poker star Annie Duke put it.Nugget #14: “These changes may be disruptive, creating discord as they are implemented.”One reason to read Chapter 15: You’ll read about a situation where University of Michigan’ professors Eric Schwatz and Jacob Anthony built an AI that transferred important decision-making authority from the legislative system to the judicial system (and seems to have been a force of good in this case as far as I can tell).Nugget #15: “The losers may be whole parts of organizations – such as Blockbuster’s franchisees that were against streaming videos.”One reason to read Chapter 16: You’ll get a nice look at how synchronization problems in a system (e.g., a supply chain) can be  alleviated through either coordination or modularity. Modularity has important limitations but can be useful in situations where coordination is not feasible.Nugget #16: “Amazon has a modular organization that has allowed it to slot better AI prediction into recommendations that minimize the impact on the rest of the organization.”One reason to read Chapter 17: There’s a good walk-through of how automating process allows business to create more value for customers through customization. And there’s some good analysis of where the insurance industry is and may be heading with its AI adoption.Nugget #17: “You want a system that can automate both the prediction and also the delivery of the products to the customers.”One reason to read Chapter 18: The authors remind us that we’re still in the “early days of the In Between Times,” but suggest that we can expect to see access to information and allocations of decision-making authority within organizations will present interesting challenges for business leaders in the near future.Nugget #18: “System innovation requires disruption, which carries with it changes in the distribution of power with winners and losers.”Since I first read Alvin Toffler’s predictive masterpiece “Powershift” in 1997, I’ve periodically wondered when I would next come across another book of comparably relevant prescience.  Is “Power and Prediction” a book that’s going to give us a whole lot of visibility into how the next two or three decades are going to play out? It’s too early to tell for sure, obviously, but I think it may be. We’ll know a lot more in 3 or 4 years. There’s a lot in this book, and it’s well worth your time and attention.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Power and Prediction: The Disruptive Economics of Artificial Intelligence

"Why?AI is treated as one type of mature technology that only requires adoption. This is not what AI is. It's not one technology. It's not yet fully mature in many of its aspects. The idea that it now can be adopted in different ways, is a bit silly.The authors distinguish between 'point solutions', 'application solutions' and 'system solutions'. Anyone with experience in a realm touched by digitalization will recognize these terms. Unfortunately, the authors choose to define these types of innovation independently of anyone who has used these terms for decades now.Combining these two criticisms, the authors suggest that it is currently possible to imminent an AI solution as a point or an application or a system solution. Even falling back on the metaphor they introduced themselves, the replacement of steam engines in factories bij electric motors, illustrates how silly this suggestion is. In the development of electric motors, the initial adoption cannot take place in any other level than that of replacement. Because there are no small motors yet. And electricity is not ubiquitous yet. Because that technology is still maturing. Equally, it seems nonsensical to suggest AI can now be adopted as system solution. It may be adopted as a rather large scale point solution, but not as a system solution. For that level of adoption, the technology is simply not sufficiently mature.But that is what you get when someone picks up three terms and starts to run with it...Good idea. Conceptually rather superficial. Annoyingly ignorant and too populist.Just a bad book.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Power and Prediction: The Disruptive Economics of Artificial Intelligence

"This didn't enlighten me much about the future of AI, the authors had some vague theory about  point, application and system solutions that doesn't seem very powerful or intuitive. The promise of AI has fallen short of many promises that were predicted and I hoped for some really good explanations of why that has happened and how it's being corrected but this book mostly discusses how people and organizations frequently resist change or don't understand new technology, something that's been true since the industrial revolution began.  There are a few dated examples of success and failure of AI but they revealed little or nothing with how it will eventually power through our society. There is no mention of chatgpt type AI systems that are currently storming the internet and this book is a recent publication  (I admit just reading the keypoints at the end of the chapters after a while, so maybe they did see it coming and I missed seeing it) I suggest simply reading current internet updates on AI applications, they will be far more relevant and timely than this book",1.0 out of 5 stars,Power and Prediction: The Disruptive Economics of Artificial Intelligence

"In a previous book, Prediction Machines, Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb examine the simple economics of artificial intelligence. ""AI is a prediction technology, predictions are inputs to decision making, and economics provides a perfect framework for understanding the trade-offs underlying any decision. So, by dint of luck and some design, we found ourselves at the right place at the right time to form a bridge between the technologist and the business practitioner. The result is this book.""Over time, technologies change but economics do not.

How did we miss it in the first place? We wind the tape back to 2017, when we were writing, to explain."" And so they do with meticulous precision. They are superb raconteurs.In Power and Prediction, Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb shift their focus ""from exploring neural networks tgo exploring human cognition (how we make decisions), social behavior (why people in some industries are keen to embrace AI quickly while others are resistant), production systems (how some decisions depend on others), and industry structures (how we've hidden certain decisions to shield ourselves from uncertainty).These are among the passages of greatest interest and value to me, also listed to suggest the scope of Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb's coverage:o Neural networks (Pages xiii-xiv and 10-110)o Verafin (x-xii 30-32)o Disruption (10-11, 18-20, 104-105, 107-117, 110-111, 111-1114, and 178-179)o Systems solutions (13-24)o Bias (22-23 and 225-235)o Causation and correlation (27-30 and 36-37)o Economic issues (45-47, 53-61, 63-64, 77-81, and 156-157)o Covid-19 pandemic (48-49, 75-81, 78-81, and 97-98)o Uncertainty (49-52,53-61, 58-59, 63-64, 77-81, and 157-159)o Greenhouse Systems (59-61)o Automation (85-90, 121-128, 162-163, and 204-205)o AlpaFold (97-98 and 101-103)o Competitive performance (111-114, 119-120, and 131-132)o First-mover advantages (129-140)o Decoupling disruption from prediction (143-153)o Probabilistic thinking (155-166)o Judgment (160-164 and 167-180)o Coordination (184-190 and 193-194)o Modularity (187-190)o Epilogue: AI Bias and Systems (225-234)These are among Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb's concluding thoughts:""Today, the individuals who most resist adopting AI systems are those who are most concerned about discrimination. We anticipate that will exactly reverse. Once people realize that discrimination is easier to detect and fix in AI systems than in humans, the greatest resistance to adopting AI will come not from those who want to reduce discrimination but rather from those who benefit most from it.""While you are reading Power and Prediction, here are two suggestions for your consideration: Highlight key passages, and, record your comments, questions, action steps (preferably with deadlines), and page references as well as your responses to the questions posed and to lessons you have learned. (Pay close attention to the set of “Key Points,” helpful reminders at the end of most chapters.)

"Power and Prediction is a combined effort of authors Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb. The authors dive into what AI future holds in every aspect of our lives. How will AI change where you work, what you drive, what you eat, your social life, and your medical? They cover many aspects so you can be prepared. I found they did not sugarcoat their predictions. You understand the possibilities of mistakes and miscalculations of the programmers.I found Power and Prediction informative yet practical. The authors wrote at a level everyone could understand, but experts in this area may find it too simple for their liking. This book is a spin-off of their previous bestseller, Prediction Machines.

"As a woman working in a STEM field, I was already aware of biases, differences in pay, workplace harassment, and more against women in the workplace. I have experienced it myself. But this book brings a much-needed investigation that goes far beyond my anecdotal incidents and really looks at the data (both what exists and what is missing) and the consequences of dismissing half of the world’s population as irrelevant or atypical.This book is arranged with a preface, introduction, six sections, an afterword, an epilogue specific to Covid-19, and almost 100 pages of endnotes and index. Although the book (sans endnotes and index) is 326 pages long, it is very readable and so brilliantly written that it’s funny, and sad, and insightful, and infuriating, and more all at once. The author brings to light numerous issues that at first glance didn’t really seem to be gender/sex-related at all but after looking at them, they actually are. I think this book would be so helpful for people in many fields, especially in leadership in corporations, government, churches, the medical community, small businesses, and more.Introduction: The Default MaleThe introduction sets up the whole book to show how nearly universally, a default male (body, size, height, weight, shape, behavior, lifestyle, etc.) is used as the default for data, decisions, planning, policies, history, teaching, models, examples, etc. and how this excludes fully 50% of the world’s population’s experiences, bodies, behaviors, needs, and values.Part 1: Daily LifeIn the first chapter, “Can Snow-Clearing be Sexist?”, the author reveals how many activities, like plowing the snow from roads, have been set up based on male norms without consideration of how females have different norms. In the case of clearing the roads and sidewalks for travel and commuting, when women’s needs and patterns were considered, it was found that clearing side roads and sidewalks prior to major roads reduced injuries and accidents and the overall cost of snow conditions compared with the plan which only considered men’s needs and patterns. Chapter two, “Gender Neutral with Urinals”, looks and bathroom usage and compares the usable square footage and time to use restrooms of men’s bathrooms, which can accommodate more men, with the needs of women who cannot use urinals, often have children or elderly to help, and have physical needs which just take longer than men. As such, equal size bathrooms are simply not equitable. And many worldwide women don’t have access to safe facilities at all.Part 2: The WorkplacePart 2 has 4 chapters. “The Long Friday” refers to a day when 90% of women in Iceland decided to strike so that their contributions, many unpaid, would be recognized. Statistically, women do far more unpaid work like childcare, elder care, shopping, cooking, and cleaning compared with men. These tasks cannot be skipped; they are essential but unpaid. “The Myth of Meritocracy” shows how advancement in the workplace based on merit favors men who don’t have essential unpaid work to do at home and can invest more at work. Furthermore, men’s accomplishments are recognized and rewarded more often even when they are not more merit-worthy than women. “The Henry Higgens Effect” refers to a character in My Fair Lady who wonders why women can’t be more like men, as if the solution is to force women to act like men rather than recognize that half of the population is not male and behaving like a woman is quite appropriate for women. The final chapter in this section is “Being Worth Less than a Shoe” and discusses workplace safety standards and equipment that were developed for men without consideration for the women and their size and physiological differences. “Women have always worked. They have worked unpaid, underpaid, underappreciated, and invisibly, but they have always worked. But the modern workplace does not work for women. From its location, to its hours, to its regulatory standards, it has been designed around the lives of men and it is no longer fit for purpose. The world of work needs a wholesale redesign – if its regulations, of its equipment, of its culture – and this redesign must be led by data on female bodies and female lives. We have to start recognizing that the work women do is not an added extra, a bonus that we could do without: women’s work, paid and unpaid, is the backbone of our society and our economy. It’s about time we started valuing it.” p142.Part 3: DesignIn the section on Design, there are three chapters. “The Plough Hypothesis” looks at cultures where farm equipment, designed for men, allowed men who have significantly more upper body strength and hand grip to become the primary income-generating farmers but in cultures that used hoes, both men and women farmed. Farming practices that favor men aren’t limited to equipment but also impact crop types. Some high-yield varieties increase the time the women had to spend on cooking and preparing the crops and “clean” stoves designed to reduce harmful smoke emissions often increase the effort and time for women to cook and tend to the food. “One-Size-Fits-Men” discusses the issues with equipment, gear, and algorithms designed for an average-sized man and how these ill-fitting products do not properly protect, and sometimes even increase risk because they do not fit properly on women simply because women don’t have the same size, shape, and expression, as an average man. “A Sea of Dudes” shares the difficulties women have getting funding for research and products for women when often men are unaware of the needs of women and don’t value funding products that they themselves don’t need. “Designers may believe they are making products for everyone, but in reality they are mainly making them for men. It’s time to start designing women in.” p191.Part 4: Going to the Doctor“When Drugs Don’t Work” looks at the practice of testing drugs and dosages on men without considering how well they work (or don’t work) on women with different hormones and physiology. My mom is only about 85 pounds and I often wonder if the standard male adult dosage is appropriate for her tiny body. “Yentl Syndrome” starts by comparing typical heart attack symptoms in men versus women. Because symptoms in women differ from men, they are often misdiagnosed, sometimes fatally.  Male-dominated funding panels impact how research funding is distributed and diseases that impact primarily women are less likely to be funded and studied. Women typically wait longer, take longer to diagnose, are misdiagnosed more often, and are not taken seriously by the medical community.Part 5: Public Life“A Costless Resource to Exploit” delves into the deliberate decision to exclude unpaid women’s work (childcare, elder care, cooking, cleaning, household activities, etc.) in the GDP. “It makes sense only if you see women as an added extra, a complicating factor. It doesn’t make sense if you’re talking about half of the human race. It doesn’t make sense if you care about accurate data.” p241. “From Purse to Wallet” looks at tax codes and how they favor men compared with women, particularly in that joint households receive tax credits to the head of the household, typically the man, and women may not have equal access to this money. “Women’s Rights are Human Rights” continues looking at how male-biased policies and gaps in government thinking are harming women. “The data we already have makes it abundantly clear that female politicians are not operating on a level playing field. The system is skewed towards electing men, which means that the system is skewed towards perpetuating the gender data gap in global leadership, with all the attendant negative repercussions for half the world’s population.” p286.Part 6: When it Goes Wrong“Who will rebuild” shows that “when things go wrong – war, natural disaster, pandemic – all the usual data gaps we have seen everywhere from urban planning to medical care are magnified and multiplied. But it’s more insidious than the usual problem of simply forgetting to include women. Because if we are reticent to include women’s perspectives and address women’s needs when things are doing well, there’s something about the context of disaster, of chaos, of social breakdown, that makes old prejudices seem more justified. The real reason we exclude women is because we see the rights of 50% of the population as a minority interest.” p290. “It’s Not the Disaster that Kills You” continues by pointing out that during disasters, it is women who are disproportionally negatively impacted. Women face increased domestic violence, trauma, displacement, injury, death, and female-specific injustices during warfare, pandemics, and natural disasters.The afterword offers some hope when women’s voices are included. Women bring valuable insight into the experiences of half the population and their experiences are good for business, economy, and humanity. The epilogue was added to specifically address the Covid-19 pandemic and, unsurprisingly, the “continual failure to systemically collect and sex-disaggregated data on symptoms, infection rates, and death rates from Covid-19.” p319. And of course, PPE that fit women (like masks) were disproportionally unavailable for the many women in healthcare settings who needed them.I found this book very well written, meticulously footnoted, and very eye-opening even though I was aware of some of the issues already. I would highly recommend the book to all leaders and all women. Although the author touched on women’s clothing and fashion, I wish she had chewed on it a little more, especially considering how men are able to purchase pants by style, waist size, and inseam whereas rarely are women offered the ability to buy based on measurements and most pants have only one inseam length as if all women are the same shape and height. Women, their bodies, and their needs matter in all areas of life and we should be considered.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men
"Published in 2019, Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Caroline Criado Perez tells the story of how women have been underrepresented, or outright missing, from studies and data as far back as data collecting goes. The author's premise is that all of humanity suffers from an inherent yet unintentional bias against women due to this lack of data.There were some eye-opening parts to this book. The data and studies are well documented throughout, which helps to prove the author's hypotheses and points. Using that data, Perez shares detailed explanations of why the lack of data on women affects decision-making for current and future generations on both micro and macro levels. I also enjoyed that many industries (transportation, technology, healthcare) and countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, UK, Sweden) were noted.While there were many great elements of the book, naturally, there are things I didn't love. The author got perhaps too biased and let her personal opinions color the data at some points. As a woman who is not a mother, I also felt that Perez did not do a great job of separating ""woman"" from ""mother."" I'm sure there's a reason for that, and for the most part, I'd guess that, around the world, most women are mothers. However, it did leave me asking questions about the data surrounding domestic work when women are not mothers. Finally, about halfway through the book, Perez began asking many ""what-if"" and ""what-about"" questions where the only solution was ""collect more data on women."" While the answer is a resounding, ""yes, we need more data on women, and we need sex-disaggregated data,"" how do we get that? What changes are we making in academia, in the field, and globally to collect new or improved data?I was left without an answer to that question.Perhaps the point of this book was to shed light on the lack of data on women. However, this book felt a bit like hot-potato: yes, it's a problem, but no one, including the author, is offering tactical solutions to remedy it.Invisible Women is a must-read, but there's still bias built-in.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men

"Did you know that snow plowing/clearing can be sexist?Yup, it is guys. Major streets, highways, and thoroughfares get most of the attention after a snowfall because duh! people need to drive to work and stuff, right? But, according to the author, this benefits men disproportionately as they have relatively straightforward commuting patterns and are less likely to use public transport. Women, on the other hand, must contend with circuitous patterns of commute (i.e. kid's school, groceries, parents, work, laundry, kid's practice, etc.) that not only expose them to less tidy roads after inclement weather, but also sloppy sidewalks that have shown to result in more injuries which translate to lost productivity and eventually more expenditure on healthcare programs, etc. And that's just the appetizer...So....women are difficult to measure, non-linearly commuting humans that do 75% percent of the world's unpaid labor, who are disproportionally affected by cuts to social programs, who are constantly being subjected to an infuriating double standard, and whose contributions to the nation's GDP has been largely unaccounted for.If you are not the ""default human"" in most studies (i.e. a male) then grab some calming chamomile tea and take your blood pressure medication or something cause each chapter is sure to make your blood boil. If you are a ""default human"" however, then be prepared to have an entirely new understanding of the word privilege...There is some overreaching in terms of the arguments that caused me to squint and purse my lips the way I do when I'm extremely skeptical about something, like when she presented the idea that it's hard for women to perform similarly to men in construction jobs cause cement bags are just too darn big and so are bricks! If they were to change the world standard for bricks though...problem solved eh?Also, apparently men drove the trend towards bigger and bigger phones, cause we have big manly hands and we can handle them whereas women must contort their digits in all kinds of ways causing them much discomfort. But they do make them smaller I thought? Anyways, the point is that they won't fit in their darn pants pockets! By Jove, If the patriarchy just stopped designing Lululemons, yoga pants, skinny jeans, pantsuits and tiny purses, then...Hmmm. Methinks women in the fashion industry have it well within their province to address these issues, yes?In general tough, this book is an eye-opening, world-view changing kind of work that has research in spades and deserves every accolade and award thrown its way.Must read recommendation!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men

"This book opened my eyes in more ways than one being the stereotypical white, entitled male living in the United States. Caroline Criado-Perez thoroughly and expertly relays the facts and the DIRE and extrodinarily unjust and unfair situation faced by women in all cultures all over the world. Half of the population is bring denied just the very basic privileges, rights, and necessary data collection needed to improve society and the human race as a whole by designing everything from politics, humanitarian care, technology, etc to better suit and benefit women. This data gap is a heinous crime against over half the human race and everyone needs to take steps to counteract it and account for these missing data by asking women directly what they want and need. It's NOT a mystery. It's simply laziness, sexism, and tying to mistakenly and incorrectly cut economic costs. Women should not stand to have to be bullied, obsequious, and servile to a patriarchy. They should not have to become more like men to fit in. History does not need any more conformists to the overriding majority in power. If a woman is the kinder, more polite, and moral person in the room, then she deserves to be praised for it by both men and women even if differs from the standard male way of acting and conversing. Men need to do better NOW to be better listeners, be willing to accept women with power, and to never treat them as anything less than an equal human being. Is all this change too much to ask? I don't think so. I think it is the least we can ask and do to progress as a society and grow and prosper as a world that is designed for Women and Men. White heterosexual men have abused there time in power and failed to solve anything.

It was so good, in fact, that I had to put it down from time to time because it upset me by delineating the sheer and overwhelming abuse-by-neglect of half the planet's population.If you are a woman, likely you know a bit of this simply by being alive. But I am betting it's still a new perspective on the ""why"" of it.If you are a man, you may know a few stats, but you almost certainly have no clue about the global and right-in-your-neighborhood ramifications of ignoring the needs of women. (Not just moms--as a reviewer here complained.) From birth, women are never the ""default"" in anything, thus the majority of systems and things never serve them well. The state of sanitary sewer or toileting systems  around the world, alone, along with a lack of running or close-to-fetch water is an often fatal injustice particularly cruel to women and girls.People who make policy--and men--need to read this.

"This is a fascinating, dense and at times infuriating book. The author Caroline Criado Perez, bombards the reader with statistic after statistic showing that, not only is the modern world built for men, much of the data we collect about that world either ignores or discounts the differences between men and women. Every paragraph, it seems, has a concrete example, such as, there are no female crash test dummies. Sometimes, scaled-down male dummies are used, but given women's different bone density and muscle distribution, even that's not helpful. Nor are there any pregnant crash test dummies, yet car accidents are the leading cause of fetal death.In many of the instances Perez cites, sex-specific data isn't gathered. One of the outcomes is that problems, such as heart attacks in females, are described as having ""atypical symptoms."" Except since females are 50% of the population, there's nothing ""atypical"" about that. Mind-blowing and infuriating stuff like that flows like water out of a firehose through the pages of this book.I said the book is dense - it's more textbook than beach read.

"Pour un livre O Reilly (qui ne m’a jamais déçu en général) vendu plus de 50 euros je trouve le contenu très moyen et assez mal pensé.Comme d’autres personnes l’ont dit, le livre est tres répétitif et il n’y a même pas de progression dans le sujet qui est mal introduit et mal défini. De plus, la majorité du contenu du livre est extrêmement superficielle à la fois sur le plan théorique et sur le plan pratique ; on a l’impression que l’auteur est assis autour d’une table et essaie d’improviser sur son sujet avec des exemples qui ne sont pas contextualisés ni expliqués (ils sont souvent également pratiquement inutiles, nous donner plusieurs fois des requêtes SQL basiques pour compter les NULL n’a rien à faire dans un livre de cette gamme).Ainsi, si le contenu du livre n’est pas totalement à côté de la plaque et offre quelques pistes sur son sujet, son contenu pourrait se factoriser en deux ou trois articles de blog.En clair, je ne recommande pas ce livre et j’ai d’ailleurs du mal à voir qui pourrait être le public cible. Un pratiquant de la Data ? Le livre est trop peu détaillé dans les solutions pour avoir un intérêt pratique. Un responsable data ? Si le livre parle un peu d’organisation (rien de plus qu’un article de blog comme on en trouve beaucoup) il contient aussi beaucoup d’exemples qui ne lui serviront à rien.Quoi qu’il en soit, le livre est très mal nommé et ne contient absolument aucun fondamental. On pourrait penser avec ce titre à une introduction des termes et des problèmes concret, du sujet en somme : cela n’a jamais lieu.

"The book feels like a marketing book to advertise the author's own business company. The content is so shallow that it really doesn't bring any value if you're already practicing data engineering for, let's say, one or two years.While the content seems to be good on the surface, it really doesn't take time to lay the foundations and highlight theoretical aspects enough. It's more like ""a mile wide and an inch deep"". Almost every important aspect only gets a very small paragraph in the book without proper guidance or explanation how to do it in practice.Here an example: There's a section called ""Scaling Anomaly Detection with Python and Machine Learning"".  So far, so good. However, except for the mentioning of some Python libraries and the usage of sqlite3 there is no Python involved. And the ML techniques mentioned are simply only measuring techniques of model performance. No, ""real"" ML involved and only mentioned as a side note that you could use (e.g.) regression techniques to improve. Sorry, but this isn't really helpful in the end.The book is full of this kind of examples. Mentioning something without really putting it into practice but then delivering really detailed SQL examples for things that are really simple and wasting time with useless case studies.To me, it feels like the author's only wrote this shallow book to highlight their own business.I always take notes when I read books. I collect the things that I think are good to know for my day-to-day job. Let's say I haven't read a book in a long time where I wrote down so few things that I think are relevant for my job.

"Data Science is perhaps unique in the following sense.  A physicist writes technical papers to be read by other physicists, as do chemists or mathematicians or ......  But a data scientist has to communicate results of analyses in a particular domain to readers familiar with that domain but lacking detailed knowledge of data science techniquesand limitations.  So effective ""communicating with data"" is more important and challenging in data science than in other academic disciplines.You might fear that a 300 page textbook on ""technical writing"" would be rather dry and sterile.  But no!  This book offers a wide scope, from conceptual overviews of organization, to presentation of graphics and pseudo-code, to detailed analyses of individual sentences and words.

"You cannot judge a book by its cover. How true. When I received the book in the mail, I was disappointed. I thought I was taken; it was hardly bigger than a booklet, while I was expecting a book of 300 or more pages. However, as I started reading I loved every word of it. It was hard to put it down and I finished the book on the very same day I received it. The author Jamal Qadri has a good grasp of the history of civilization and current world affairs. He presents an overview of the tussle between modern civilizations post-Spanish Inquisitions. That was the beginning of the downfall of the Islamic civilization in the 1490s and the rise of western civilization and colonialism. I would call it a Colonialism History 101.The author then quickly moves to his thesis that the US, which has become the leader of western civilization after WWII is losing its leadership role. He hypothesizes that the policies of the current Trump Administration are causing, if not already caused it, a precipitous drop in the decline.  To make his case, he cites getting out either completely or diminishing her readership roll in many and critically important economic and political international treaties and agreements. These include, for instance, NATO, Paris Climate Accord, TTP, NATA, and Iran Nuclear deal to name a few.  The United States’ diminishing roll on the world stage will surely affect the dominance of the Western civilization in the world in a critical time when other civilizations such as Chines and Islamic are more than flexing their muscles.  I solely subscribe to the author’s hypothesis.In the final chapter of the book, the author asks: so what does a concerned American citizen do. Then he lists twenty-some very poignant questions.It a very timely book to come out. The only reason I did not give five starts is: while the author presents a very good background to his thesis and makes convincing arguments, the look lacks the data and references, which could have given more credibility and convincing argument to the thesis presented.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"The United States of America: the Superpower, the Trump Presidency & the Fall of Western Civilization"

People like me who don’t have much time to read, especially about politics and just want to know what’s going on and why- this is great.

This book was recommended as supplemental reading for a machine learning class I took in college. It did a good job summarizing topics in enough depth for getting the main ideas but wasn't overly detailed and bogged down with language.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book
"In a small number of pages, the book covers many topics, and it is a good introduction for beginners or people managing a team of data scientists. On the flip side, it lacks depth, being more like a general summary on the topic. The value is that it explains a lot of methods and good practices, so many that even the expert is bound to learn something new, about some popular topic he heard about but only has a vague idea of what it means. This book will fill this gap.For in-depth coverage of selected modern machine learning topics with new research results focused on applications and a unified approach, with plenty of Python code yet 150 pages total, I suggest checking out my book ""Intuitive Machine Learning and Explainable AI"", also self-published.Such books are very well rendered in the PDF version, however the print version does not give them justice. Mine will never be printed, and if by chance it ever does, it will be on high quality paper and in color. Even then, a print version will always lack the HTML-like navigation features available in online versions.Compared to other similar books, at least Andriy's book has high-quality figures printer in color, and well rendered on paper.

"Disclaimer: The author asked me to review this book, though I had already purchased my own copy.  I promise to be 100% honest in how I feel about this book, both the good and the less so.Overview:This book does exactly what it states.  It's a 100+ page book that gives you an overview of machine learning, the math behind most of the reviewed techniques so you can follow along with current research to an extent), and QR code links to further reading.  The author also follows a 'read first, buy later' policy, which I respect.The book is very well organized, giving the reader an introduction and discussion on the mathematical notation used, a well written chapter that discusses several very common algorithms, talks about best practices (like feature engineering, breaking up the data into multiple sets, and tuning the model's hyperparameters), digs deeper into supervised learning, discusses unsupervised learning, and gives you a taste of a variety of other related topics.What I Like:This is a well rounded book, far more so than most books I've read on machine learning or artificial intelligence.  After reading through this, I feel like I can competently discuss the subject, read one of the simpler machine learning research papers, and not be totally lost on the mathematics involved.  The language used is concise and reads very well, showing very tight editing.What I Didn't Care For:I know that this is a general introduction and meant to be kept short.  Like many other reviewers, however, I would have enjoyed a deeper look into everything that was in this book.What I Would Like To See:I know that the author is currently writing a data engineering book without the 100 page limitation.  Personally, I would like to see him write a ML Math book (I'm weird like that) as well as an MLOps book.  I expect the later to be what he writes next, if he chooses to continue writing.Overall, I got a LOT out of this book and look forward to more.  I am giving a rating of 4.8 out of 5.

"While this book is presented as a primer for Machine Learning enthusiast and practitioners ranging from beginner to expert, I would argue against diving headfirst into it if you have not done some pre-work first. To be fair, the book really is well put together and does a great job of explaining and connecting various ML concepts. However, to get the most out of this text I recommend the following build-up process before reading.First, read the “Machine Learning for Everyone” post on the vas3k blog to make sure this is a topic you are really are interested in, and to demystify yourself of that the idea that all of this ML stuff is synonymous with AI. Second, take a Python course at either codecademy or a similar online self-paced learning website. Then I recommend taking a Linear Algebra course at a site like Kahn academy, especially if it has been many years since your last math course. Lastly, I recommend taking a Data Science course at either General Assembly, Kaggle, or Data Camp to get the basics and generally terminology down. At this point you will likely be a bit overwhelmed and wondering how to form one coherent big picture of all of this stuff you just learned.It is at this point where the “The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book” comes in perfectly. It resets all you have learned to this point into one coherent picture. Reading it at this point also will require less look up of the referenced topics, math, and libraries / tools. While the book is only 100 pages and reads fast, it is probably best to chunk it up into no more than a chapter a day and read it over two weeks. It has also has a long shelf life because you will find yourself referencing back to it from time-to-time.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book

To avoid that, click on ""See All Buying Options"" button and choose *Amazon.com* as the seller.I'm a software engineer currently working for a big tech company. This is hands down the book you need to grok and master machine learning concepts. As a programmer, I have felt capable of utilizing the machine learning tools available, but have felt distant from understanding the many cited academic papers. I can confidently say, just a few chapters into this book, that this is the book I was missing!I have followed Andriy on LinkedIn for a long time now, and always appreciated his posts. When I saw he was publishing a book, I didn't think twice and ordered it. As expected, the book is clear, concise and does a thorough job explaining basic mathematical concepts, machine learning principles, and the most important fundamentals to understand the field.One note: I can tell this book will be useful for a long time. I have many tech related books that become obsolete a few years or even months after they are published. Andriy's approach delves into the core principles, while explaining how to understand further developments into the field. This is something I was missing and truly appreciate.I have a quirk of reading physical books alongside a text-to-speech interface on a digital device. Especially with text books, this is helpful, but not all textbooks are capable of being processed this way.

"In 2018 I was nominated for Data Scientist of the Year for Nashville, and became a finalist. Machine learning has been a big part of my career since 2005. I would like to say I don’t need a book like THPMLB, however, it is a fantastic resource. There is math in this book, and the reader will want to find a resource to become familiar with the notation, if they don’t already know it. I’ve always found the notation is the first filter for people getting into science of any type. However, the notation is more complex looking than it is once you know what the symbols mean. In the end, all math devolves down to a few basic operations and notation simply implies several assumptions about how to apply them.What makes the book excellent is the very plain-speaking method in which the lessons are taught. This isn’t someone trying to impress PhD’s in their field. This is someone looking to talk to you about machine learning. This straightforward approach will help you learn machine learning techniques.For someone like me, it offers a handy reference to techniques I’ve used but forgot the details to, or techniques I’ve wanted to explore. Its small size makes it easy to find what you are looking for, get a basic understanding, and launch you into further learning.Finally, this is a living product and there is a constantly updated wiki for this book.

"As a professional software developer, it's hard not to notice the tremendous excitement around and potential in Machine Learning and especially Deep Learning these days. At the same time, for a complete newbie to the field, the space is so big it can be overwhelming to know where and how to get started. I went into this book knowing that Machine Learning and Deep Learning were a thing (but how were they related?), and that matrices were involved somehow... I just wanted to get a good vantage point of the field and an overview of the terms I'd seen bandied about.The book delivered, in spades. I like that it went over what it called the ""Fundamental Algorithms"" and then spent a good portion of time on neural nets and the kind involved in deep learning, and then gave a flavor of so many different kinds of other algorithms and use cases out there.The level of rigor was just right for me, as someone familiar with calculus and linear algebra from many years ago, but the refresher the book gave was very helpful.My one complaint is that it didn't go into Reinforcement Learning very much at all.

Nevertheless, it was quite helpful in that it allowed me to look through someone else's eyes at the problems I encounter at work.

I did glean some interesting ideas from it.The book really covers almost all aspects of analytics department in a company: what are the tasks, what tools are used, who and how works with it all, what to expect and how to grow.Some things I would have filed a little differently, some I did not agree with, but in the whole book I did not come across some detached from reality things. It feels like the author has picked up more than one rake along the way from starting his career in analytics to writing this book.The only thing I'd call a drawback of the book is the math chapter.The whole book to that point assumes that the reader has no knowledge of statistics. And there's the ""normal distribution"", the ""histogram"",  ""the median is the value that divides the sample in half"" and so on. Readers who're not in math won't understand it at all, I've checked. And then we also talk about the distance of percentiles from the median, without explaining what percentiles are. I would move the paragraph with the definition to the place before the first use of the term. The exponential distribution is also without any prior definition. In general, the chapter goes sharply into mathematics.I would definitely recommend this book to executives who have not yet had experience with analytics beyond basic tools like spreadsheets in excel.I would recommend this book to analysts who have had professional experience but don't yet really understand the role of analytics in business.And I would recommend this book to people who already have some experience and understanding of how business works, but are just about to get into analytics.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Roman's Data Science: How to monetize your data

Personally, I’m not an engineer nor a mathematician but I have worked in tech for over 20 years and I completely understand the importance data takes in making solid business decisions. I really enjoyed the chance to learn more about how data science works from a behind the scenes view.The last two chapters on “Challenges and Startups” and “Building a Career” were particularly fascinating to me. Getting a hold on data management and analysis early in your startup life is absolutely essential. Knowing how to analyse and present project ideas backed by solid data is the standard now and career limiting if you can't do it. Roman makes it much easier to understand the power and usefulness of data.Furthermore, reading this book gives you an insight into a different culture - Russia.

"First of all, as some other reviewers have pointed out, the subtitle of the book should include the word 'Bayesian' in some form or the other. The reason this is important is because the Bayesian approach, although an important one, is not adapted across the board in machine learning, and consequently, an astonishing number of methods presented in the book (Bayesian versions of just about anything) are not mainstream. The recent Duda book gives a better idea of the mainstream in this sense, but because the field has evolved in such rapidity, it excludes massive recent developments in kernel methods and graphical models, which Bishop includes.Pedagogically, however, this book is almost uniformly excellent. I didn't like the presentation on some of the material (the first few sections on linear classification are relatively poor), but in general, Bishop does an amazing job. If you want to learn the mathematical base of most machine learning methods in a practical and reasonably rigorous way, this book is for you. Pay attention in particular to the exercises, which are the best I've seen so far in such a text; involved, but not frustrating, and always aiming to further elucidate the concepts. If you want to really learn the material presented, you should, at the very least, solve all the exercises that appear in the sections of the text (about half of the total). I've gone through almost the entire text, and done just that, so I can say that it's not as daunting as it looks. To judge your level regarding this, solve the exercises for the first two chapters (the second, a sort of crash course on probability, is quite formidable). If you can do these, you should be fine. The author has solutions for a lot of them on his website, so you can go there and check if you get stuck on some.As far as the Bayesian methods are concerned, they are usually a lot more mathematically involved than their counterparts, so solving the equations representing them can only give you more practice. Seeing the same material in a different light can never hurt you, and I learned some important statistical/mathematical concepts from the book that I'd never heard of, such as the Laplace and Evidence Approximations. Of course, if you're not interested, you can simply skip the method altogether.From the preceding, it should be clear that the book is written for a certain kind of reader in mind. It is not for people who want a quick introduction to some method without the gory details behind its mathematical machinery. There is no pseudocode. The book assumes that once you get the math, the algorithm to implement the method should either become completely clear, or in the case of some more complicated methods (SVMs for example), you know where to head for details on an implementation. Therefore, the people who will benefit most from the book are those who will either be doing research in this area, or will be implementing the methods in detail on lower level languages (such as C). I know that sounds offputting, but the good thing is that the level of the math required to understand the methods is quite low; basic probability, linear algebra and multivariable calculus. (Read the appendices in detail as well.) No knowledge is needed, for example, of measure-theoretic probability or function spaces (for kernel methods) etc. Therefore the book is accessible to most with a decent engineering background, who are willing to work through it. If you're one of the people who the book is aimed at, you should seriously consider getting it.Edited to Add:I've changed my rating from 4 stars to 5.

"Usually considered to be a branch of artificial intelligence, especially at the present time, pattern recognition is defined in this book as the automatic discovery of regularities in data by the use of computer algorithms and the use of these regularities for classifying the data in different categories. The first part of this definition is typically referred to as `unsupervised learning' and the latter `supervised learning.' Both of these areas have resulted in a gargantuan amount of research due to their importance in areas such as medicine, genomics, network modeling, financial engineering, and voice recognition. This book emphasizes a ""conceptual"" approach to teaching pattern recognition, and therefore is highly valuable to those who need to learn the subject. Too often this field is taught purely from the formal standpoint, or conversely by the use of many trivial examples that illustrate the algorithms that are used. These approaches make the subject appear to be either a highly-developed mathematical one (which it is) or a cookbook that does not have a sound foundation. This book is one of the few that will allow the reader to gain a more in-depth understanding and appreciation of the subject as preparation for doing research and development in pattern recognition. The author claims that the book is self-contained as far as background in probability theory is concerned, but readers should still be prepared with this background in order to better appreciate the content. The Bayesian paradigm dominates the book, as it should given the current emphasis in research circles.Some of the highlights of the book include discussions on:* Relative entropy and mutual information. These two concepts have become very important in recent years, especially in the validation of pattern recognition models, the selection of relevant variables, and in independent component analysis.* Periodic variables and how they can be used in contexts where Gaussian distributions are problematic.* Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, especially the role of the detailed balance condition in obtaining the acceptance probability for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.* Bayesian linear regression and its ability to deal with the over-fitting problem in calculations of maximum likelihood and the determination of model complexity.* Kernel learning (usually called support vector machines in other books).Some of the minuses of the book include:* Needs more in-depth discussion of Bayesian neural networks, over and above what is done in the book. The author's does devote a section in the book to this topic, but given its enormous importance, especially in automated learning and economic forecasting, more examples need to be included.* More real-world test cases need to be included, along with a comparison of the efficacies of different approaches, so as to illustrate the ""no free lunch"" philosophy.* More exercises that require more analysis on part of the reader, instead of derivation-type problems or straightforward numerical exercises.* Needs more details on independent component analysis. Only a few paragraphs are devoted to this important topic.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"I recently had to quickly understand some facts about the probabilistic interpretation of pca. Naturally I picked up this book and it didn't disappoint. Bishop is absolutely clear, and an excellent writer as well.In my opinion, despite the recent publication of Kevin Murphy's very comprehensive ML book, Bishop is still a better read. This is mostly because of his incredible clarity, but the book has other virtues: best in class diagrams, judiciously chosen; a lot of material, very well organized; excellent stage setting (the first two chapters). Now, sometimes he's a bit cryptic, for example, the proof that various kinds of loss lead to conditional median or mode is left as an exercise (ex 1.27). Murphy actually discusses it in some detail. This is true in general: Murphy actually discusses many things that Bishop leaves to the reader. I thought chapters three and four could have been more detailed, but I really have no other complaints.Please note that in order to get an optimal amount out of reading this book you should already have a little background in linear algebra, probability, calculus, and preferably some statistics. The first time I approached it was without any background and I found it a bit unfriendly and difficult; this is no fault of the book, however. Still, you don't need that much, just the basics.Update: I should note that there are some puzzling omissions from this book. E.g. f-score & confusion matrices are not mentioned (see Murphy section 5.7.2) - it would have been very natural to mention these concepts in ch 1, along with decision theory. Nor is there much on clustering, except for K-means (see Murphy ch 25). Not a huge deal, it's easy to get these concepts from elsewhere. I recommend using Murphy as and when you need, to fill in gaps.One more update: I've been getting into Hastie et al's ESL recently, and I'm really impressed with it so far - I think the practitioner should probably get familiar with both ESL and PRML, as they have complementary strengths and weaknesses. ESL is not very Bayesian at all; PRML is relentlessly so. ESL does not use graphical models or latent variables as a unifying perspective; PRML does. ESL is better on frequentist model selection, including cross-validation (ch 7). I think PRML is better for graphical models, Bayesian methods, and latent variables (which correspond to chs 8-13) and ESL better on linear models and density based methods (and other stuff besides). Finally, ESL is way better on ""local"" models, like kernel regression & loess. Your mileage may vary...They are both excellent books. ESL seems a bit more mathematically dense than PRML, and is also better for people who are in industry as versus academia (I was in the latter but now in the former),",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)

I purchased this book to help me with a research project I am doing on my own with pattern recognition where machine learning is important to the process.  Many of my own equations as I did my research appeared in this book.  I am using a relational database to store information and remember patterns.  If you don't have experience with numerical methods and turning equations in to computer code and can do it in your head.  You will have great deal of difficulty with this book.  That said as a warning, now to the book.  It is a great reference and spends a great deal of time several statistical theories and their practical uses in signal and pattern recognition.  It also has various ways for doing curve fitting and dealing with weighted neural networks.  While this is written as a text book, it is more of reference book.  I do not see how even a years course could work on all the information in this book.  One of my chief pet peeves is that text book publishers have websites and answers only professors can get to.  How about those of us who are finished with school and have no intention of ever going back?  So to the publisher Springer I give one star and zero if I could!  This is a reference book and most likely will never be a text book. This is true with this book.  Which is why I rate it four instead of five stars because of the publisher.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"I was a big fan of Bishop's earlier ""Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition"" despite my not being particularly interested in neural networks (as opposed to other aspects of machine learning), and so I was pretty excited when I heard about this book.  Reading it has not left me disappointed.  Like his earlier book, this text is quite mathematically oriented, and not well-suited for people who aren't comfortable with calculus.  However, also like in ""NNPR"", the writing style here is very clear, and everything past basic calculus and linear algebra is well-explained before it's needed.  The appendices alone are a goldmine.  (Appendix B is a great ""cheat sheet"" for commonly used probability distributions; Appendix C has lots of useful matrix properties you may have forgotten or never known; Appendix D quickly explains what you need to know about the calculus of variations; and Appendix E does the same for Lagrange multipliers.)  The author also does an excellent job throughout the text of marrying math and intuition without giving either short shrift.However, note that the material covered is inherently pretty complex, so the book can still be intimidating in parts despite the excellent writing.  It's more appropriate for, say, Ph.D. students and professional researchers in statistics or machine learning than people who just want to crank out code for a simple classifier.  There is very little pseudocode (although copious MATLAB code will supposedly be made available in a companion book due out in 2008), and the book's overall approach to machine learning is basically hard-core Bayesian statistics.  If you are not willing to scratch your head for a while over lots and lots of equations, this may not be the book for you.On the flip side, people who are already experts in machine learning may be mildly disappointed with the lack of coverage some of their pet topics get.  For example, while the chapter on graphical models is excellent as far as it goes, it only mentions the problem of learning graphical model structures (one of my areas of interest) in passing.  Reinforcement learning (another personal area of interest) is discussed briefly in the introduction and then written off as beyond the scope of the book.However, the book is already a fabulous resource as it stands; complaining there's not even more of it would be gauche.  The cover may look like goat barf, and there are some innocuous missing words here and there (hey, it's a first edition), but if you're serious about machine learning and not afraid of a little math, you should definitely own this book.  I can only imagine how much cooler my own thesis research might have been if this book had been around a few years earlier.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"Overall, I like the book and would recommend it. But the exposition could use significant polishing.Pros:- not mathematically heavy; lots of good heuristics that capture the math without delving too far in- choice of topics and their discussion (e.g. a great place to learn about kernel methods and graphical models)- easy to get hooked on if you mind the gapsCons:- read below...While the exposition is spotty (compare e.g. with Feller or Gelman), the author manages to follow a mostly linear exposition on fascinating topics.The book would highly benefit from editing provided by someone with a solid math background. In particular, there are more good mistakes than bad mistakes... Often when speaking with people with more stats background than me, the conversation is isomorphic to:Me: ""...therefore, this statement is wrong. I think what he meant was...""Bro: ""Ah yes. But you get it, that's what he meant""Me: ""Then why didn't he write it?""But at least dialogues like these help cement ideas...Please correct me if any of the following contentions are wrong (I may update as I continue to read):Some parts are not even wrong, for example:Sec 2.1, paragraph above Eq. 2.19""We see that this sequential approach to learning arises naturally when we adopt a Bayesian viewpoint. It is independent of the choice of prior and of the likelihood functions and depends only on the assumption of i.i.d data""First, if you follow the thread of this section and therefore go back to the contrived coin-flipping example, you would see that in the non-Bayesian point of view estimates are also updated in a sequence of experiments. Hence, a Bayesian point of view in this case is no more ""natural"" than a frequentist. Second, by definition of i.i.d., a single fixed distribution is postulated to exist, and therefore a prior is in fact chosen: how do you define a posterior without a prior? But ok, I think I get it: a sequential approach fits in nicely with the Bayesian point of view - I agree, and that's all that needs to be said.Mathematically wrong:Same section, following 2.3.5, the statement(s) following Eq. (2.20)""Note that in the limit of an infinitely large data set m, l -> infinity the result (2.20) reduces to the maximum likelihood (2.8).""First, if F is a function of x, then the resulting limit for x to infinity must not involve x. Plus, the order and/or direction of his m and l in the limit is ambiguous. Second, what he meant to say is that for m and l both sufficiently large compared with a and b, we get that (2.20) reduces to (2.8).3rd paragraph before 2.2:""For a finite data set, the posterior mean for mu always lies between the prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimate for mu corresponding to the relative frequencies of events given by (2.7).""Again we are told to forget that the choice of a prior makes a difference. It seems the above statement is false: we may choose a prior that is heavily weighted on a single point so that this prior's mean is greater than mle.Paragraphs directly above the beginning of 2.2:""In fact, we might wonder whether it is a general property of Bayesian learning that, as we observe more and more data, the uncertainty represented by the posterior distribution will steadily decrease..."" and then"" this result shows that, on average, the posterior variance of theta is smaller than the prior variance.""The ""result"", i.e. Eq (2.24) is an assertion of the form: ""Suppose a,b, c > 0, c is fixed, and c = a +b. Then, if b goes up, a must go down."" I don't see how this relates to what seemed to be his premise that increasing the size of a data set (sequentially or not) has the seemingly desired effect of reducing posterior variance. I suspect there are in fact limiting results in special cases that show the desired ""steady"" reduction in posterior variance...I wish he would have referenced themSection 2.3, following Eq. 2.44""... we note that the matrix \Sigma can be taken to be symmetric...""Actually, by definition any covariance matrix *is* symmetric.I could go on...All this said, it's worth repeating:I like the book, and not only because its mistakes or sometimes shady logic encourage the interested reader to try and discover correct/less wrong statements.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"I have two machine learning books currently; this book and the one by Prince on Computer Vision. I purchased Prince first, and followed up with this book, since in some ways I found Prince lacking some details and found some of his explanations difficult to follow (forward-backward algorithm for example), but overall was is good book and worth getting. I think in someways these two books are good compliments to each other. Prince focus heavily on application and sets up the problem, but does not necessarily tell you how to solve the problems (at least to the satisfaction of someone new to the topic like me). Bishop on the other hand does go through a lot of the details left out in Prince, but lacks examples to reinforce why I would even care about some of the topics covered. For example, I eventually skipped chapter 10 (approximate inference) after not seeing any immediate application for such an abstract topic.So back to why I am only giving this book only 3 stars. While Bishop does go through much of the math required to solve these types of problems, I ultimately find many of his explanations not very good. As one other reviewer pointed out, he has plenty of figures, but seldom do I think they provide much insight to what he is trying to explain. Case in point figure 11.1 is nothing more than two squiggly lines showing p(z) and f(z), one of which is an arbitrary probability density function and an arbitrary functional mapping of z. I think that by the time most people get being able to understand the material presented up to this point, they don't need this kind of figure. There are a few others, that while not as useless as this, could use a bit more description or clarification. Otherwise these figures are nothing more than squiggly lines.There are many topics here that I was hoping to learn from. For example, I had never learned anything on neural nets, and there is a whole chapter dedicated to that topic here. Unfortunately, I think the only thing that I can remember from this topic is that there different layers to the net, and I think in the process of him solving the equations of the neural net was ultimately using reverse auto-differentiation, but he even had some other goofy name for it (I think it was backward propagation). Another topic I was hoping to learn from was on support vector machines. I think this suffers from getting so buried in how to solve the problem, that even his examples show fairly complex decision boundaries (Figure 7.2, for example where he doesn't call out on the graph as showing what is what).And another issue with this is that the book has an appendix which describes the datasets used to generate many of the plots. However, if you go to the URL, the datasets are not there. Granted, the book was published in 2006, so certainly his website could have changed. It just is difficult to try and duplicate his methods to understand what he might ultimately be trying to say here.All in all, the book isn't bad. I think it works better as someone who already has an application in mind (and which method to use) but needs to be walked through the math to get an answer. After reading this book, I still wouldn't know which technique to use to get an answer to a problem that I have. Prince at least gives some applications and was a really interesting book.Update 9/22/16:I maybe was overly hard with my original review, however I will not be updating my star rating which I will explain why shortly. I read another machine learning book after this one ( Barber's Baysian Reasoning and Machine Learning). Overall, that other book is worthy of a 5 star review for learning the basics. After reading that book, which gives plenty of examples and clear explanations, this book does read a lot better. As I originally thought, this book does fill a good role as a book on how to solve problems, but not necessarily as a great starting place for those new to Machine Learning. Check out Barber's book for free from his website, and you will see what I mean.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"I can appreciate others who might think that this is a great book.... but I am a student using it and I have some very different opinions of it.First, although Mr. Bishop is clearly an expert in Machine Learning, he is also obviously a HUGE fan of Bayesian Statistics. The title of the book is misleading as it makes no mention of Bayes at all but EVERY CHAPTER ends with how all of the chapter's contents are combined in a Bayes method.  That's not bad it's just not clear from the title.  The title should be appended with ""... using Bayesian Methods""Second, while it is certainly a textbook, the author clearly has an understanding of the material that seems to undermine his ability to explain it.  Though there are mentions of examples there are, in fact, none.  There are many graphics and tiny, trivial indicators, but I can't help to think that every single one of the concepts in the book would have benefited from even a single application.  There aren't any.  I am lead to believe that if you are already aware of many of the methods and techniques that this would be an excellent reference or refresher.  As a student starting out I almost always have no idea what his intentions are.To make matter worse, he occasionally uses symbols that are flat-out confusing.  Why would you use PI for anything other than Pi or Product? He does.  Why use little k, Capital K, and Greek Letter Kappa (a K!) in a series of explanations. He does.  He even references articles that he has written... in 2008!!Every chapter seems to be an exercise to see how many equations he can stuff in it.  There are 300 in Chapter 2 alone.  Over and over and over again I have the feeling that he is trying to TELL me how to ride a bicycle when it would have been so much easier to at least let me see the view from behind the handle bars with my feet on the pedals.  Chapter five on Neural Nets, for example, is abysmally over-complicated.  Would you hand someone a dictionary and ask them to write a poem?  (""Hey, all the words you need are in here!"") Of course not.Third, the book mentions that there is a lot of information available on the web site.  The only info available on his website is a brief overview of the text, a detailed overview of the text (that's not a typo.... he has both), an example chapter, links to where the book can be purchased, and (actually, quite useful for creating slides) an archive of all of the figures available in the book.  There are no answers to problems or explorations of any part of the material.  The upcoming book might be amazing and exactly what I am looking for but it could be months away and another $50 or so to purchase it.  Hardly ideal. How about putting some of that MatLab code on your site?  *Something* to crystalize the concepts!Finally, while the intro indicates this might be a good book for Computer Scientists it would actually make more sense to call it a Math book.  More specifically a Statistics book.  There are no methods, no algorithms, no bits of pseudo-code, and (again) no applications are in the text.  Even examples that actually used hard numbers and/or elements from a real problem and explained would be much appreciated.Maybe I am being a little critical and perhaps I want for too much but in my mind if you are writing a book with the goal of TEACHING a subject, it would be in your interest to make things clear and illustrative.  Instead, the book feels more like a combination of ""I am smart. Just read this!"" and a reference text.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"Bishop's book about machine learing and pattern recognition is well written and the figures are really pretty because they are in color and informative. Overall the book looks very nice and it is fun to read in. In my opinion only the book 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' by Hastie et al. looks comparably well.The book is a textbook rather than a monograph and, hence, intended for students rather than researchers and the coverage of machine learning topics is thorough without being able to cover every topic in deepth. This is not really a draw back because no book is able to do this anyway. The presentation of the methods is informative and, depending on the background of the reader, clear enough to figure out how it works to use the method.What is the problem: I do not like that the methods are introduced not rigourously but by examples. That mean Bishop does not have the definiton, theorem, proof style but is more heuristic. This may sound very helpful for the reader not familiar with the topic to reduce the barrier of understanding by providing examples to visulalize the problem. The problem is, in my opinion, that this is not the case but the oposite. In think it is never wrong to provide examples and it is absolutely desirable but after the examples are given and one has an intuitive understanding of the problem one wants to see its formal solution because that's what machine learning is about, it is applied statistics. For this reason I give only 4 instead of 5 points (but not less because also all the other books about this topic fail in this respect).Overall, the book is well done and certainly a good source of information for students and researches.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"This graduate-level book is a very good reference for classic pattern recognition and machine learning methods. It might not be the best book for a first-time learner though since the author tends to jump-step a lot. This is understandable considering the amount of content and insightful discussions covered. For advanced learners, this book is one of the best. I really appreciate the mathematical discussions and derivations provided, which are essential for me to derive my own algorithms or models. I don't feel that it is lacking in examples at all. It actually has lots of good examples with great mathematical insights. (Again, this is from a researcher's perspective, not from a perspective of the end user of algorithms.) It also gives me solid mathematical backgrounds to understand state-of-the-art algorithms in research papers easily.This book tend to focus only on probabilistic, in particular, Bayesian methods (and does an excellent job doing that). Other important methods are mentioned very briefly or only discussed from the Bayesian perspective. I believe that each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses and this book does not do those approaches enough justices. Therefore, this book is not a comprehensive reference for pattern recognition and machine learning as it discusses these problems from mainly one perspective. But if your studies are in these areas, this is one of the top 5, must-have reference books.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"In order to appreciate this text it is important to understand what it is not. It's not a compendium of data science techniques but a curated view of topics that those new to the concept of data science should understand. The author is well qualified to cover this material and does so in a logical order. After covering some basic concepts the text provides a brief introduction to UNIX, Python, R and RStudio, and MySQL. Then it goes into more detail on statistical models, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. It concludes with a chapter of examples using social media data, which gives the student some insight into APIs and wraps up with a chapter on data collection and experimentation. There are several appendices, including one on ethics that are valuable.I selected this text for a graduate class I teach for technology management students. Generally the students have limited programming experience and are looking for some insight into what data science is and how it works. I like the hands on approach to give the students a better feel for the tools of the trade and the challenges. For instructors, the author provides lecture slides, answers/programs for the problems and in-chapter exercises, datasets or links to datasets, and lecture slides. All of which makes adopting a new text much easier.I wouldn't be a good academic if I didn't pick a few nits with the author. I would like to see more emphasis on data cleaning as that comprises much of the time spent in a data mining application, but the text does cover it and it's up to the instructor to make sure the students get the full appreciation of what is entailed.  I'm also planning to introduce the tidyverse and tidymodels packages for R, which greatly simplify data science operations, but I think that is beyond the intended scope of this text.Full disclosure: the publisher did provide me with a complimentary copy of the text but I had already purchased the Kindle version.

"“Data science,” the three authors of this book point out, “is a very wide field, so wide indeed that a book ten times the size of this one wouldn’t be able to cover it all. For each chapter, we picked a different aspect we find interesting. Some hard decisions had to be made to keep this book from collapsing your bookshelf!”In my view, they have made very good choices. This “Introducing” book is written well and logically organized. And it generally is aimed at individual  computer users and persons contemplating possible careers in data science. The book also could be good for managers and others trying to get a handle on how some data science techniques could be brought to bear on their growing mounds of business data.If you are impatient to dive straight into dicing, slicing and graphing big data, you should know that books from Manning generally don’t follow that kind of quick approach. You get some overviews, explanations and theory first, and then you ease into the heart of the matter. In this book, you get to “First steps in big data” in chapter five, after first delving into the data science process: 1. Setting the research goal; 2. Retrieving data; 3. Data preparation, 4. Data exploration; 5. Data modeling; and 6. Presentation and automation.Chapter five also is preceded by chapters on machine learning and how to handle large data files on a single computer.The “First steps” chapter, meanwhile, shows how to work (at the sandbox level) with two big data applications, Hadoop and Spark, and demonstrates how Python can be used to write big data jobs.From there; you move on to (1) the use of NoSQL databases and graph databases, (2) text mining and text analytics, and (3) data visualization and creating a small data science application.It should be noted and emphasized, however, that “Introducing Data Science” does present “An introductory working example of Hadoop” at the end of Chapter 1. The authors explain how to run “a small application in a big data context,” using a Hortonworks Sandbox image inside a VirtualBox.It's not grand, but it’s a start.Near the beginning of their book, the authors include a wise quote from Morpheus in “The Matrix”: “I can only show you the door. You’re the one that has to walk through it.” This book definitely is a good entry door to the huge and changing field of data science.

"Loved this book! If I could have given 6 stars, I would have.This book would provide you with a very well rounded approach to Data Science and by that I mean truly would give you a ride though all the aspects of this field versus showing you some regression algorithm using python and call it Data Science.Book has it all - not only it leverages probably the most favorite language (python) for its examples, it also goes in details in supporting tools and eco systems. For examples, Spark - Why create something when Spark is already here and we can just use it in our work.It covered NoSQL technologies to give readers enough information to get started and weighted pros and cons of each. I especially enjoyed reading ACID, BASE and CAP theorem sections. I am familiar with them and gave presentation on exact same topic few years ago and I enjoyed the read since it covered the important key points leaving me with nice warm feeling in my stomach that unaware readers will be in a good hands!During discussion of NoSQL, ElasticSearch was introduced and entire chapter was devoted on how to leverage search capabilities to provide us with valuable results... Search is something that ElasticSearch does best! Section about Damerau-Levenshtein was great. It made you think of dirty data that is present in the real world and how you deal with it (vs giving you example with perfectly clean and ready to use data)Speaking of real world experience - this book took a step back and instead of trying to be data science book and throwing cool python libraries at you, it talked about general approach in the real word when you deal with data science projects by trying to make you think of project's research goals - Why are we doing this? This was done to help you think and to help you pick the right solutions.Another example of real world problems was their chapter on dealing with big and i mean truly big data. In some sample program, you can surely play with tens of hundreds of sample records, but what do you do with gigs or more of data? while running production servers, you are not dealing with 2-3 lines of log entries, you deal sometimes with gigs! So I was very happy to see section that talked on how you can tackle problems like that.Authors did a great job in my opinion by cloning and making it available pywebhdfs package that would work with their example of the code (they did use now outdated hortonworks sandbox that made it hard to follow in few chapters, but it was not hard to figure out where menus/buttons were moved)A nice final touch that I felt was great was section on results visualization. How would you communicate what you found to others? will you point them at some hard to read print out, OR shows them a picture/graph that makes your findings easy to read?So... many many gems in this book that would really give you a great overview of the field of data science and would get you started not only in strictly academic / demo only way, but also in real life production environment.I definitely would be re-reading this book and recommending it to my colleagues!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Introducing Data Science: Big Data, Machine Learning, and more, using Python tools"
"I've only read through page 50, but I have already found several errors.  A particularly egregious one occurs in the first code listing, in which a regression model is fit through the origin even though an intercept should clearly be present.  The data for the regression model is created as follows:  two predictors, let's say x1 and x2, are created from the uniform(0, 1) distribution.  The response = 0.4 x1 + 0.6 x2 + error, where the error term is also distributed as uniform(0, 1).  That being the case, the intercept should be close to 0.5, the mean of the uniform(0, 1) distribution.  You may wonder what difference that makes.  Well... if the correct model is used, the model coefficients end up being close to the actual coefficients used to create the data, namely 0.4 and 0.6, instead of 0.7658 and 1.1252 as shown in the text.  In addition, R-squared for the correct model is about 0.3, a far cry from the ""high"" value of 0.893 reported by the authors.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Introducing Data Science: Big Data, Machine Learning, and more, using Python tools"
"This book is a great introduction into data science with step by step examples. The chapters take  business problems and show how to find and display solutions. The authors put together a data science process which gives a road map on how to begin and cycle through a project. Each step in the process is outlined with examples on how to implement. While most data science books focus only on machine learning, this book places machine learning in context of a business problem with important steps such as data preparation.To be clear, machine learning is included with algorithm explanations in the book complete with Python code examples. This includes typical data science topics such as sparse data, text mining, supervised and unsupervised learning. Data scientists tend to split into ""R"" and ""Python"" bins and this book is a shout out to ""Python"" . A nod is given to ""R"" with the availability of the RPy library and ""R"" popularity.The authors address scaling Python code with both optimization and using big data tools. They give a crisp overview of the Hadoop framework and the memory advantages of using Spark. Another important part of data science is working with data and this book provides an excellent overview of SQL and NoSQL databases complete with ACID and BASE concepts and contrasts. Special attention is given to graph databases arguing that this is a contender for efficiently modelling complex data.This book is great for the aspiring data science to become familiar with the data science process.

"This book is absolutely useless if your goal is to figure out what data science is and how you can apply it in a business context.You will spend hours typing in code (which is full of errors mind, I have some understanding of Python - but if you have not then you are stuffed), only to find that the results is a matrix that apparently tells you if a URL is trustworthy (for example). Which URL? No idea and book doesn't tell you. How am I supposed to apply this to anything. Doesn't tell you that either. What do you with this information.

I like the first two sections and my review is based on them. It provides alternative design patterns that I did not know before and they are purely practical. No theories involved",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Machine Learning Design Patterns: Solutions to Common Challenges in Data Preparation, Model Building, and MLOps"
"My background: I'm an expert software engineer (C++, Java, etc) and proud n00b at machine learning.  I've read the O'Reilly ""AI and Machine Learning for Coders"" book and many online articles. I have a background in trading/financial software, which exposed me to many statistical terms in this book. In the past, PhD level physics/math quants would typically handle those topics and this book has helped me realize some gaps in my knowledge and fill them (sometimes via online search).  I can now at least reason about those concepts better even if I don't yet understand the details.I'm 1/3 into the book (so maybe premature for 5 stars) and it's been a dense but interesting read so far.  There have been times where I have to lookup terms but the material has still been approachable.  The language in the first couple chapters could probably be simplified some but it was sufficient for me with a lot of coffee.  I expect to still have very incomplete knowledge after finishing this book due to lack of practical experience. However, my goal is to build a large scaffolding of knowledge/concepts on ML that I can use as a foundation for future learning and broaden my toolbox before I start hacking code.  When I was learning C++, I found the Gang of Four book ""Design Patterns"" accomplished a similar goal to help bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical software engineering.  Much like with the GoF book I suspect I may be re-reading parts of this book in the future when my knowledge has matured.  Some may prefer doing a lot of ML coding before reading this book, but I like to have a lot of background knowledge/tools before tackling code - personal preference I guess.I seem to have discovered an error/typo regarding ""precision"" vs ""recall"" in chapter 3:Page 135 paragraph 2: ""If we care more that our model is correct whenever it makes a positive class prediction we'd optimize our prediction threshold for recall"".I think the last word in that sentence should be ""precision"".

"I struggle to identify the right audience for the book. On one hand, the book only scratches the very thin surface of machine learning practice. Any ML researcher/engineer with light experience of using ML in practice are well familiar with a lot of the techniques described in the book, so from this lens the book is probably oriented to newbies or even layman. However, the book (intentionally?) omits large parts of technical details, so anyone who's not familiar with the describe approach won't understand how it works at all by reading the book.

"I am a highly critical reviewer, so when I have something good to say, it means a lot.  This book is written so well and taught me so much!  It discusses topics where people often focus on one aspect and ignore others, which is counter to the topic of equality.  This book is such a refreshing change.  It is rare to be able to say this on this topic:  I believe that no matter your viewpoint on equality and how to achieve it, you will greatly enjoy this book and benefit from it.On paper, equality is such a simple topic – give everyone equal treatment, without considering irrelevant information to each decision.  Where it gets complex is correcting entrenched inequality and biases.  The book gives such thoughtful discussions.  It gives an unbiased and optimistic view of technology making life nicer.  At the same time, it doesn’t oversimplify the topic – I learned to recognize more aspects of its complexity.  While this is a must read for policy makers on all levels, it is also important for everyone to read.  After reading this book, I am excited to tackle the topic of inequality, and am highly motivated.  I have much better tools to do so, thanks to deeper thinking on the topic.  I expect to use what I learned in so many different settings.  I am also comfortable talking to anyone about this topic in a way that promotes a constructive discussion.The writing style is very nice and personable.  It turned a tough topic into one that is a pleasure to read about.  I give serious thumbs up to this book!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Equality Machine: Harnessing Digital Technology for a Brighter, More Inclusive Future"

"Scholarly presented and supported with relatable examples by an author who is not only an academic, tech savvy, highly educated law professor, but a “real life” wife and working mother.  Beginning with the indisputable premise that the tech genie had left the bottle, we are presented with two unacceptable options; one to fear and vilify, the other to succumb with blind embrace.  Lobel presents here the delicate third rail; first to recognize the existing contributions of A.I. and second to actively engage it’s progressive potential.  Being 64 years old, somewhat intimidated and occasionally fearful of change, I began this book with an anti-A.I. bias.  In this book, the author has moved the needle for me closer to what she describes as “becoming cautiously optimistic and smartly constructive about where we are heading.”  A great read!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Equality Machine: Harnessing Digital Technology for a Brighter, More Inclusive Future"

"This remarkable book instructs readers on how technology has already disrupted ordinary practices in multiple aspects of our lives and how that same technology might be harnessed in service of a fairer and more just society.  From hiring pratices to credit reports, from care-giving robots to dating apps, Professor Lobel surveys the landscape offering one productive suggestion after another for how  we might program computers to eliminate biases and stereotypes,  improve medical diagnoses, and tackle problems now hiding under the radar.  Professor Lobel wisely navigates between naive techno-optimism and the prevalent fears of AI as nothing more than a tool for turbocharging existing inequities.

"I read Kuhn and Johnson's Applied Predictive Modeling text when it first came out and have the upmost respect for their ability to explain difficult topics with an applied slant. Extremely good book. This text follows very much in the same vein, and I do recommend it, especially for data science practitioners with less than 5 years experience. As someone who has been working as a data scientist for nearly a decade, I was even able to glean some feature engineering nuggets that I had not encountered before (and had ashamedly forgotten).Now ... here is my critique:First, Kuhn and Johnson should be absolutely infuriated with whoever at CRC did the layout for this book. The plot/graphic decision placement in the hardcopy version of the text is just bad ... and there are some GREAT plots in this book. It feels like only about 25% of the time a plot/graphic actually resides on the same page(s) as which it is referenced. This requires the reader to constantly be flipping back and forth between pages disrupting the flow of what Kuhn and Johnson are attempting to present. In other words, the ergonomics of this book don't work, and by halfway through my read, I pretty much wanted to stop reading. Maybe the digital version of the book is better, but the hardcopy just had this issue that was very distracting for me. I never thought I'd write a review that included graphic placement as a topic, but this text warrants it.Second, the book lacks a comprehensive treatment of feature selection with time series data. While temporal data is addressed in the first half of the book. it is not addressed in the last three chapters regarding feature selection (which may be among the most valuable and content-rich in the entire book). Their suggestion of external and internal resampling with cross-fold validation is extremely valuable when using IID data. However, they make no recommendation or even mention about how to utilize this resampling ideology with temporal data.Don't get me wrong ... I really, really like this book and I do think there is incredibly valuable content that nearly every data scientist (experienced or new) would be able to take away from it. However, I just can't give it a glowing 5-star review when it feels like there is a bit of a void when it comes to addressing feature selection involving time series data.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Feature Engineering and Selection (Chapman & Hall/CRC Data Science Series)

"Given that I think that Applied Predictive Modeling (APM) is one of the best applied statistics books ever written, I had high hopes for this and I am not disappointed.  The beginning of this book recaps many of the key ideas from APM and then takes you through the process of choosing and tweaking the features you will want to use for modeling. This book shares the same easy to read style as APM and it has excellent well motivated advice.  I have been doing statistics and statistical programming for decades and I still found many novel data manipulation tricks, graphics and methods.The book itself does not directly integrate and discuss code (instead there is pseudocode to explain ideas/algorithms).  Happily the github repository has the materials to reproduce the work.

"Chapters 2 to 6 are pretty good (parenting; sports; career; business), but the chapters on dating, relationships, personal style, and happiness are quite weak.A lot of the actionable advice given in those chapters assume that you're only interested in optimizing for that one thing. The author doesn't take into account the implications beyond that one thing. This, to me, was a flaw throughout those chapters:Chapter 1 - chapter on dating. advises not to focus on looks in a potential long-term partner, since that doesn't lead to happiness in a relationship. Assumes that the only factor is happiness, and not the genetic advantages of future children you'll have with her. Which is ironic, because later chapters in the book stress how important genetics and looks are for success.The chapter on dating also suggests to wear an extreme look, to be successful on dating apps. Assumes that dating is the only thing you're interested in, ignores the negative effect that could have on other social interactions.Chapter 7 - since wearing glasses leads to improvement in appearing competent, author concludes that he should wear glasses. Assumes that appearing competent is all that matters. Ignores, for example, overall attractiveness. Also, the chapter takes as a given, without explanation, that politicians appearing competent in photos doesn't actually mean they're competent. It's likely that in fact that real information regarding competency can be gleaned from photos.Chapter 8 - Chapter on activities that leads to happiness says that sex by far leads to the most happiness. So the author recommends doing more of that. He then tells some personal stories that anecdotally imply that woman want more sex than men, when studies show that the opposite is the case, on average. Baumeister famously says that men are doomed to a life of constant sexual frustration. (It is unclear if “self-love” is included in the very high ranking of ""Intimacy/Making Love"".)He then gives the bizarre advice to prioritize being drunk before and after social events, as opposed to during, to optimize how much happier alcohol makes you. Assumes that drinking alcohol is simply for additional pleasure in the moment. Ignores the aspects of alcohol being a social lubricant and removing inhibitions, allowing one to take advantage to make social connections and create enjoyable memories (even though he discusses related ideas of Kahneman in that chapter).An additional critique is that unfortunately, the ideas in the book often rely on a single study, not accounting for the importance of multiple studies, which the replication crisis in psychology has shown the importance of.To summarize: Entertaining, breezy, read; with some interesting ideas; mostly fails as a self help book",3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Trust Your Gut: Using Data to Get What You Really Want in LIfe
"I’m not quite sure why this book was written… the description leads one to think you’re going to learn some surprising ways that your gut has been leading you down the wrong path, but most of what he writes about only backs up common knowledge.For example, did you know good looking people do better in their careers and in their dating lives? They get more matches in dating apps? The author’s data shows that. But his “surprise” is that, even if you’re ugly, you can do things to appear more attractive, confident, and trustworthy. Like wearing glasses and keeping groomed. He spends a lot of time talking about his own dating profile to back this up. Not really anything noteworthy here.Another one: did you know the most successful people are the ones who work the hardest? He shows that the business people, artists, and musicians who do he best are the ones who put in the most effort, whether it’s engaging in business decisions, putting on art shows, or touring extensively.None of this is rocket science and it’s all stuff your “gut” would have told you. Most of the book is about these obvious things that’ll leave you wondering why you just read that chapter. This book should have been titled “Your common sense was right all along.”It’s not all bad. There are a few interesting nuggets in here, but overall I wouldn’t recommend reading the whole book just for those.And I hate to criticize writing style because writing a book is hard work, but his style doesn’t make one believe he’s an expert in this stuff. It’s too simple and not tight.Honestly this book seems like your average co-worker data scientist needed to give a presentation on what he’s been doing for the past year and then decided to bind it into a book.

"Well written and engaging, this book uses ""Big Data"" to evaluate the accuracy of conventional wisdom around common human activities. The range of activities covers dating, parenting, wealth and the psychological holy grail of the source of human happiness. While the author translates boring research results into interesting action items, the results them selves are less counter-intuitive than expected or hinted at by the author. Being told that being out in nature provides more happiness than a work meeting or rich people tend to own boring, profitable businesses wasn't that surprising. Ditto for working at a job with friends is better than working with acquaintances. In short, the author does a good job summarizing lots of data based research in a more captivating way than a professor.  Many results the book highlights are less surprising than hinted at and mostly amount to ""it's what you've always been told but with a slight addition to make it even better"".

"While I can't speak for everyone, I think it is safe to assume that we all have memories of learning mathematics. For some, those memories are good and enjoyable; for others, the memories are akin to torture; for still others, the memories fall somewhere in between. Wherever you fall on the ""math is awesome"" to ""math is torture"" spectrum, I think we can all agree that mathematics affects many, many aspects of our lives - even when we are not the ones going the math.And, just as students who are first learning mathematics, sometimes there are mistakes. Some mistakes are simple and some are complex, but they all serve to remind us that nothing is infallible. Matt Parker, mathematician extraordinaire (the title I bestowed upon him) presents to us a wide variety of examples of mistakes in this book. Some of the mistakes had effects that were relatively minor, causing only setbacks and headaches, while others were much larger effects, causing immense damage and loss of life.Some of the stories I was already aware of (the Gimli Glider, the airplane which ran out of fuel mid-flight and had to be glided to the ground - completely safely, I might add - because of a change in the units of measurement being used for the fuel), while others were completely new to me. All of the stories Parker provides in this book go a long way to show that mathematics is not infallible, and it is only as good as the people using it. And also that anytime computer code is to be used on a new machine - regardless of how good you think that code is, and how much you swear the code is great and won't fail - make sure to review every bit of that code BEFORE using it in the new machine. I would say ""lol"" at this since it seems like a simple thing to remember but, given the number of examples where this check not being done led to the loss of lots of money and life, it is definitely not a laughing matter.One of the best things about this book is that, despite it being about mathematics and having quite a bit of mathematics included within, it can be read by someone who doesn't have a strong mathematical background. While there are certainly places where Parker goes into detail, he also acknowledges that some readers' eyes might glaze over at that and provides explanations that are easily understandable.I encourage everyone to read this book because I think it's important for us all to not only understand how much in our lives is affected by mathematics but also how badly things can go wrong when the mathematics used does fail and just how simple some of those failures can be. Much like the goal of CHI+MED initiative, spreading the knowledge and awareness this book provides is important in reducing these types of mistakes from happening in the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Humble Pi: When Math Goes Wrong in the Real World
"The author’s analysis of Excel’s error propensity omits that professional programmers are trained best practices and gotchas while learning their program languages, however Excel frequently is dropped on desktops with zero training. Excel can be coded to be readable and self-documented and peer reviewable. I admit Excel is best used as a tool to summarize data that is found in real databases. I must confess that I have found mistakes in my own workbooks, most due to bypassing good programming practices. All good programmers know that there is no such thing as a minor change. All changes should be tested and verified.Music theory: I agree with Parker’s opinion. Music theory was developed by musical geniuses, but “theory” should answer ‘whys?’, not just ‘because I said so’. When I picked up ukuleles, I refused to study music theory because intervals are measured strangely and things like perfect-fifth is never justified as perfect, etc. Then I found “Harmony Explained: Progress Towards a Scientific Theory of Music” by Daniel Shawcross Wilkerson. Here were the whys and a mathematical construction of a real theory.A couple of minor nits:I think it is bad form to write a “humorous” book about mathematics (I never use the term “maths”) and then take pot shots at another nation’s leader(s). I would not write a book about ukuleles and slip a couple of snide remarks about the royal family.In the story about the meme ('317 million people in America and you spend 360 million on just introducing Obamacare? Just give each citizen a million bucks'.), the author implied the post was from the right. Maybe, maybe not. I found no evidence that the original post came from right or left, but it’s not relevant. BTW, I did repost the meme…with an LOL.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Humble Pi: When Math Goes Wrong in the Real World
"Math is hard, there is no doubt about it. At first, math seems so understandable; numbers seem so real and concrete. But the more you dive into the pool of mathematics, you begin the notice you are swimming in a sea of concepts and abstractions.I found math so confusing because no one could explain its relevance. Though I must admit, many of the things I learned in high school seem irrelevant now. (I’m looking at you, Jane Eyre).However, I don’t blame math. I blame math teachers. Knowing how to solve for ‘X is much different than understanding why we solve for ‘X. So when you combine a teacher that cannot teach and a student that does not want to learn, education does not happen.Over the past few years, I have picked up a few books that help shine a golden light on the fantastic world of mathematics. Humble Pi is another fantastic volume. Humble Pi focuses on (mostly) hilarious errors in the real world. Most of the errors seem to be computer-based, or better yet, Microsoft Excel-based.From calendars to gears to bridges, the book covers a vast array of topics. Math simply describes the world we live in, the world we create, and the chaos that ensues. This book simply and enjoyable captures it for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Humble Pi: When Math Goes Wrong in the Real World
"I am not educated in math and never use anything more complicated than arithmetic in my work. But Humble Pi shows how pervasive math is in many unsuspected corners of our society.Most of us take it for granted that the engineers who designed this bridge knew what they were doing. And they did--the fact that the bridge exists says they did a whole lot of things right.That doesn't mean there isn't a mission-critical error or trap in some calculations so that at some point, the bridge will not behave well. We can't inspect all the bridges before we use them. We have to live our lives trusting in other people's math.Parker writes clearly and entertainingly. The book is almost never dry or incomprehensible. It has made me see the world I live in differently and, perhaps, more wisely.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Humble Pi: When Math Goes Wrong in the Real World
"I get it. Matt Parker really, REALLY, doesn't like Trump. He should realize, however, that conservatives also buy books.The book contains about a dozen cheap shots aimed at Trump or his administration. No cheap shots at any other American politicians or administrations. If you don't mind that kind of one-sidedness in a popular math type book, then you can add back one star to my rating.Now to the insurance understanding... On page 128, during a discussion of that CRAZY Trump administration trying to knudge the maximum allowed old-age to young-age premiums from 3 to 3.49 (arguing that 3.49 rounds down to 3) uder the ACA (Obamacare), the author attempts to math-splain insurance thusly ""Theoretically, medical insurance should be a game of averages, the goal being that everyone should share the burden equally.""  NONSENSE. There's this little thing called underwriting. The cost to the insurance company for insuring various age ranges varies DRASTICALLY. To such an extent that even the unilaterally passed ACA allows for a ratio in the premiums for young vs old. Limiting the ratio by fiat to 3, creates a situation where the premiums paid by the young are actually much higher than they would otherwise be. This was done in order to force the insurance companies to subsidize the old at the expense of the young. This situation creates a death spiral. The young, seeing they are being grossly overcharged in relation to their risk opt out and in turn tilt the whole average cost even further in the wrong direction. What the Trump administration was trying to do was to allow for a closer-to-reality ratio between the premiums paid by young and old. In their attempt to change reality via law, the Democrats passed a law that has in it the seeds of its own demise; an insurance premium vs. cost death spiral.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Humble Pi: When Math Goes Wrong in the Real World
"I'm not mathematician but I deal with numbers on a daily basis via my job. This is a great cautionary tale on the pitfalls of dealing with numbers. The book is entertaining, but can get slow in some parts especially if you don't hold a full interest in all things math. I do some python programming so at one point I had to test one of the items he brought up for myself to see what happened.If you deal with numbers on regular basis I highly recommend reading this book and highlighting it in kindle. Some of what happens is funny but also quite tragic. In many cases you could possibly hold someone's life or lively-hood in your hands based on the math you use. Too err is human, too really screw something up it takes a computer.What I learned from this book:-How computers do division-How computers do random numbers.-That Matt Parker keeps dice in his pocket in case of a random emergency.-That Matt Parker needs family to intervene when he starts getting obsessive over coin flipping.-a neat and probably useless cheat in space invaders-Daylight saving time increasing heart attacks is a myth, but I still believe DST will one day kill me anyway.-How a woman in Germany became a super villain.-Reboot your missile defense system often as possible!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Humble Pi: When Math Goes Wrong in the Real World
"This was endlessly fun to read with my eight year old. Based on the stories, it spawned discussion about counting in hexadecimal, setting data types in Excel, thinking of all the combinations two 2x4 Lego bricks that could be made (pictured), and so much more. My eight year old delighted when his mom was punched in the gut at the humor--mom likes reading the same stuff I do!? We homeschool and reading the HISTORY of math and science has been THE best education for these topics. Humble Pi: When Math Goes Wrong in the Real World acts as a sort of history of math, even if it is a very modern version of history. We're learning about what humans did--poorly. This delights my son, who is crazy excited about all things engineering, like no other. The stories are interesting, relevant, and teach without teaching. We naturally learn what topics may be relevant to the real world, because all of these errors caused actual real life problems.

"If you watch YouTube videos of Standupmaths or Numberphile, you'll be familiar with Matt Parker.  If not, check him out.  I had good math teachers in school, but maybe only one that came close to being as good as Mr. Parker is.  This book, for which I've been waiting for the American release for a while, was worth the wait.  Through focus on consequential, sometimes humorous, math errors throughout the ""real world,"" (most of them not too tragic, but a few truly sad), he helps the reader realize, if they didn't already know, how important math always has been, and how that importance is only going to increase.  The audiobook, read by the author, is a real gem, and great commuting material.Yes, I'm a fan.  I recommend his books, his videos, and whatever else he does.  He's also appeared as a guest on QI and on The Infinite Monkey Cage (his joke about the statistical tees test didn't get nearly the laughs it deserved, mainly because the punchline depended on familiarity with tests of statistical significance).

"I have the earlier version of this book which was based on Scala and it was great. I was so impressed that I used it to develop a course on Big Data Analytics at my university. So I was pleased when I learned the authors were planning a revised version based on PySpark, and decided to switch my course over this semester. Big mistake. The new book is filled with errors -- most of the code included in the book won't run unless you make significant changes, and the GitHub repository for the book still holds the code from the older version, at least as of this writing (mid-October 2022). You also get the impression from the text for some of the chapters that the revision was just slapped together without much care (to paraphrase, ""You could do this, but we won't show you how."")I do hope the publisher and the authors get together to fix this and issue another revision that addresses the many problems with the current one.

"Easily a book that could have been a five-star contender, unfortunately, there are some shortcomings.Overall, the text is a fine (but basic) introduction to data science through applications of common marketing analytics to problems such as: engagement, conversion, retention, churn, recommendations, forecasting, segmentation, experimentation, lifetime value, etc.What it does well is that it provides exposure to a wide range of applications of data science techniques to some pretty good datasets that somewhat replicate what you'd see out in the wild. The author also shows some data manipulation and aggregation techniques that I was not familiar with, like the use of ""Groupers"" combined with timestamp resampling inside of ""group_by"" operations. His notebooks are all neatly organized in the book's repo and the code is very readable.From here on out, the book is a bit of a letdown. The most salient of its shortcomings involves the depth (or lack thereof) of its exposition when it comes to the technique or algorithm being discussed. There are a couple of simple formulas here and there and very short explanations of what the algorithms are doing behind the scenes. I guess that's ok if it is meant to be an intro and not a full-fledged encyclopedia, however, I cannot overlook the sidestepping of common pitfalls and best-practices when it comes to leveraging these techniques in other places.For instance, in chapter 6 (collaborative filtering) the author walks the reader through the application of user-user and item-item collaborative filtering using unary matrices and cosine distances, without mention of assumptions made of the data (you need a lot), on the shortcoming of the technique (collaborative filtering doesn't work well for new users or new items), why you'd want one vs. the other (user-user CF is much more computationally expensive than item-item since one is more likely to have more users than items), or why you'd use cosine distance vs. Pearson (mean centering), etc. This is pretty much the case in each section.There are some editing quibbles as well. Chapters 5, 7, and 8 are pretty much rehashed from earlier chapters, so there's no reason why the material couldn't have been consolidated.Also, I wonder what the folks at Packt were thinking in packing essentially the same book twice into the same print - one for R and one for Python. If you are a Python user, then half of the book is dead-weight (the R chapters and vice-versa). Why not have ""Hands-On Data Science for Marketing with Python"" and ""Hands-On Data Science for Marketing with R""?I have no issues recommending this book to students in an introductory class as long as there's some adult supervision.

"This book is painful to read:1. There are multiples bugs in the code presented.  Example: Multiple times a go routine will pass a failure into a channel inside a loop, but not return from the function.  Thus the go routine will continue to run to the end of the loop even though the rest of the work is useless.2.

"I bought this book as soon as it was released and I have to say it was a very good purchase. This book fills a significant gap that existed in the landscape of ML books. You either had books heavily focused on ML algorithms and best ML practices or other books which focused on distributed system and low-level workings of systems like Kubernetes. Before this book, there was a gap in the middle. And this book fills the gap. It is a great guide for data scientists who start at a company and have to deploy an end-to-end pipeline into production either on GCP or AWS.The examples are well-chosen and don't illustrate only simple pipelines, but also advanced techniques like real-time inference or automatic feature extraction.Naturally as with any book, it depends what are your expectations. This book will not teach you Ml algorithms, neither will it teach you how to deploy Kubernetes on an in-house cluster. But there is a lot it will do. I am very happy with my purchase.Naturally, some parts could be a bit improved. All the pieces are very well explained individually, the book can give a bit more insight into how to tie everything together (e.g. in one big Ml Platform). Also, more junior practitioners could appreciate a recipe for what to tackle first. Some examples are a bit out of date due to the constant evolution of GCP and AWS but that's just a minor problem.

"I had been trying to use matplotlib on Pi and Windows Python installations with little success for a few weeks before buying this book.  Also, I had never used Anaconda or Jupyter.  Chap 1 gives great step-by-step guidance for setting up Anaconda, and once that is done all the Python examples work like a charm.  I have both the print  version and ebook.  I enjoy having the print book at hand so that I do not have to switch screens frequently.  I haven't found the code files provided to readers necessary as not much typing is required to enter the examples, and the manual entry process does help to clarify the process and make me attentive to details I would otherwise miss.  A fringe benefit is that I have become comfortable with Anaconda/Jupyter on my Windows computer.One of my goals was to use matplotlib on my Raspberry Pi 3B+.  I had tried before with little success.  After reading a couple of chapters of Data Visualization, I realized that the problem resides in the old Pi operating system.  I upgraded to the newest version of he Pi OS at RaspberryPi.org.  This is the Pi OS that comes with the Rasp Pi 4, but it can also be used by older Pi models.  Then, I used pip or sudo apt-get (can't remember which) to install matplotlib on the Pi.  I was able to run the examples from Data Visualization on Thonny which is the editor included with current version of the Pi OS.  To see the graphs in Thonny I found it was necessary to add the line plt. show() as last line in the examples.  The plt.show() line was not needed when I ran the examples in Jupyter on Windows computer.I am extremely pleased with this book.  It really is pitched to the level of a beginning Python user.

 Recently, I have been studying data visualization based on Python – a common language programming. Thus, I looked for several lesson videos on YouTube and the other physical material, such as books, science magazines. At that time, my friend recommended to me the “Data Visualization with Python for Beginners”.For me, I hate reading books, particularly books related to science so I just often watch the instructions as well as lessons through videos. However, this book changed my view of reading science books because of its interest with valuable knowledge of data visualization before starting the other important processes such as data science, machine learning, data analytics.Besides, this book is divided into 10 chapters including a lot of exercises with keys to practice, and examples that help us to understand easily so far.In the first chapter, readers can learn how to set up the Python environment with Anaconda application needed to run various data visualization. Moreover, the author also describes steps to set up this app in detail with both Windows, MacOS and Linux versions.In the following chapters, the beginners will start to learn and practice the different data visualization libraries, consist of Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn from basic plotting to advanced plotting.In my opinion, if you want to start studying this data visualization using these libraries, this book would be your best choice to read before achieving higher goals in the data science field.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Visualization with Python for Beginners: Visualize Your Data using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn (Machine Learning & Data Science for Beginners)"

"This was a good attempt at something marvelous, unfortunately it is only that: an attempt; the book falls rather short. I dearly wanted to give a very positive review for this book as the premise of it was incredibly promising. I purchased it, and it sat on my bookshelf several months before I opened it beyond a quick peruse of a few pages. Those brief glances at the opening pages only added to my excitement about sitting down with the book later.However, once I actually did get the time to read this book cover to cover, I was immensely disappointed. The three stars given are primarily because the book starts off very strong; the coverage of binary search and the intro to Big-O provides precisely what was promised. Yet, these are only about the first 20 pages. After this beginning, the book becomes somewhat erratic, I cannot for the life of me understand why more of the sorting algorithms were not covered. The only sorts covered are quicksort and selection sort. There is a section titled 'Mergesort vs Quicksort' in which merge sort is only mentioned, not described or explained at all, and this is only a single paragraph; insertion sort gets only a sentence.The book's treatment of recursion is fantastic, but gets at my worst frustration with this book: the author discusses and thoroughly describes basic recursion, providing excellent illustrations of the call stack during execution and tracing the entire execution of a recursive function. At the end of this exercise, he mentions tail recursion (a critical aspect of recursion that more than merited the explanation, which would not have taken much more considering he’d already explained the call stack) and says it's beyond the scope of the book. However, the second half of the book is then dedicated to advanced topics like K-nearest neighbors (solid explanation) and just mentioning things that one would end up studying elsewhere on one's own. A whole chapter is dedicated to Dijkstra's Algorithm (again, solid coverage), which is a somewhat advanced algorithm that benefits from his illustrations and descriptions, but leaves to question, who made the decision to leave out a more complete description of recursion and thorough coverage of searches and sorts in lieu of what at the end seems like filler chapters? Anyone who is at the point of needing to understand those two algorithms likely won't read an illustrated book on the topic; to me, these topics supplant those someone intrigued by the idea of this book might've come seeking.There are errors, but they're no biggie. The very first piece of code in the book contains an omission that causes it to malfunction (setting of the variable 'mid' should divide the sum of 'high' and 'low' by 2). I came to realize it may have been due to a page layout or typesetting issue as I found the same problem in several chapters. It seems the edges of the code are partially covered by images. The coverage of Big-O beyond the intro chapter is a little weak, and only helped because I had some previous knowledge of the concepts surrounding it, and the fact that much of the explanation is repeated several times, so some bits finally sink in. I could see how someone coming to this book hoping to have 'aha' moments about algorithms would be left very lost.The author also uses the technique of describing how something works in a simple way and then a section later taking it all back and saying 'this is really how it works'. I've seen this before, and it can be effective, but a writer must take care the manner in which he simplifies the initial example. This happens rather confusingly in the explanation of hash tables (associative arrays) in relation to their performance. If you're following his description of them, its clear that him saying they return values 'instantly' is somewhat odd particularly when you understand what O(1) actually means. When he follows up to clarify, which he does by describing how hash tables can be slow in some cases, the clarification isn't really satisfying as you didn't really absorb the chapter wondering if perhaps you missed something before since hash tables were glowingly described as the data structure to end all data structures. He then goes into discussing (incompletely) the implementation of hash tables, which he keeps saying 'you'll never have to do'. He then trails off with a brief description of things to consider when using them without really implementing a hash table in code as suggested (examples 'using' hash tables are given, but the mention of 'implementing' them comes after this and indicates an upcoming example which never materializes).I wrote this review only as a warning. The implementation of the book is a solid 2 stars considering the price; the first half gets it to 3. The book is about 50% as described, 50% the author seemingly trying to prove he has a CS degree. Perhaps friends told him the book was too simplistic. Unfortunate. The heavy appearance of 5 star reviews here greatly misled me. Reading them afterward, it seems most are praising the idea of the book and not its actual execution. Had I read it during the return period, I would have returned it. I am a intermediate-level programmer. I understood most of these topics at a basic level beforehand. I ordered this book because I had been recommending it to others, who wanted to learn about algorithms from scratch, as the premise of it sounded excellent. I finally decided to read it myself since I've been raving about it for the last year; I wish I had read it first. It's a fun read, but don't expect any epiphanies. If you're a beginner, you're actually better off searching ""basic sorting/searching algorithms"" online and learning from YouTube videos until you can grasp the content of a college textbook (or one of the programming interview prep books which cover algorithms very thoroughly without the math of a university text). This book starts off great, but finishes more like a set of blog posts written over the course of a year, by a person who couldn't wait to prove to you how smart he was becoming day by day. I know many times a project can start off as one thing, and then after input by many people and via your own desires to do something great, lose its way; it seems that may have happened here with the author deciding that the basic algorithms were too mundane, and choosing to try and explain more impressive concepts which somewhat ironically, are ‘beyond the scope of this book’.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People

"I'm gonna keep this short (EDIT: that..definitely didn't end up happening) because I haven't gone through the whole book yet, so **disclaimer** on that part.  But after just the first couple of chapters, I was very impressed.I'm a 'seasoned' programmer, I would like to think (industry experience at a “top” company, CS degree, coding all my life, etc), and so almost all of this book is ""review"" for me.  I'm going back through fundamentals in preparation for coding interviews, as I'm back on the market for a job.  I'd say this book does these things very well:1) Fills in the gaps that might've always been there - What I mean by this is, if you maybe got a bachelors in computer science, there could easily have been some material that just didn't completely sink in or that your curriculum didn't focus on.  I think going through this book is a great way to make sure those gaps are filled.2) Explains concepts in an easy to grasp form - The examples that are used in the book are great.  There's one example early on with big O involving drawing 16 boxes on a piece of paper.  One way is to draw 16 boxes one at a time - yielding O(n).  Another way is to fold that piece of paper in half each time.  This gets your 16 boxes in only 4 folds - big O(log n).  It's simple, yet a great way of showing the difference in the two.3) Keeps your attention - I love to buy books and then not read them… it’s a talent that I exercise often… One thing I can say about this book is that it actually keeps my attention, and I enjoy reading it.  That’s saying a lot if it can do that.  How much good is a book if it’s too boring to focus on and get through?  If you don’t read it, it doesn’t matter how quality the content is.I’ve recommended this book to several people in my life already, and I wish I still had my Amazon affiliate account setup because I feel like a freaking spokesperson for the thing..!  Haha.In summary:  I would recommend this book to a very wide range of people—ANYONE in computer science looking to get a job, anyone trying to get a degree or just take anything CS related, anyone interested in some of the CS fundamentals, anyone looking to review computer science concepts, anyone wanting to dip their feet into a new field of study they haven’t explored before.I wish I had this book when I was an undergrad—It would’ve saved me so much headache and difficulty.I’ll update this review once I’ve finished more of the book, but from what I’ve gone through so far, and compared to plenty of other programming books (algorithms, interview prep books, etc), it’s by far my favorite.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People

"I wanted to hate this book. I bought it because I wanted to learn algorithms to use on the website leetcode. And of course I was doing Leetcode algorithm problems so I could eventual get a job in computer programming. So, with that in mind I will put some context in place, for starters I have been practicing coding for about 1 year more or less (self taught of course, udemy, youtube, etc). I was absolutely  struggling on the easy algorithm questions on leetcode, so naturally I figured I would turn to some source material for help. A computer programmer that was also a youtuber recommended this book, and here we are.The book itself is short at 217 pages, but easily 40% or more of the pages are pictures or diagrams explaining itself, so you will breeze through this book in one or two sittings if you wanted. As far as the writing and readability is concerned I would say this author does a great job of simply explaining the concepts and what not, but often you can tell he is leaving out a lot. It is true that he doesn't provide a lot of computer code for most of the algorithms he covers, which is somewhat odd. A lot of what he aims for is basic understanding or the theory behind the algorithms. So, if you want to implement what you learned often you will be frustrated and having to google what algorithms that covered.Overall, I would say that the algorithms he covers is something that I sadly needed as I had no idea what they were to begin with, and from the sound of it some if not all the algorithms are basically covered in computer science course you would take in college, and probably at the freshman, or sophomore level at that (at least based off the comments I have read on leetcode about the algorithms this book covers). So, for me this book is pointing me the right direction in what to look up, but again the author doesn't spend a lot of time going in depth on any single algorithm or necessarily how to implement them in various ways.  And at times the author is not useful at all for example, he just goes over the concept and states the obvious and then moves on to the next algorithm.For me I would say that I learned a lot from this book, and I can understand a little bit of what those computer programmer youtubers are talking about on the hard algorithms (at least some of the jargon they use I can understand now.) But, overall for me in terms of implementing what I learned from this book into code I would say that I got maybe 10% better at algorithms.Would I recommend this book to you? Well, it depends if you are advance, or intermediate programmer, no, unless you forgot everything about algorithms. If you are new then yes.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People
"If you are new to data structures and algorithms, I guarantee that you find this book a helpful resource with a single caveat: make sure you are the target audience.From the author:""Who should read this book?This book is aimed at anyone who knows the basics of coding and wants to understand algorithms. Maybe you already have a coding problem and are trying to find an algorithmic solution. Or maybe you want to understand what algorithms are useful for. Here’s a short, incomplete list of people who will probably find this book useful:• Hobbyist coders• Coding boot camp students• Computer science grads looking for a refresher• Physics/math/other grads who are interested in programming""In my opinion, the reason this book is so much better than traditional resources on the subject is that the author adheres to a few basic principles that I find fundamental to learning.From the author:""About this bookThis book is designed to be easy to follow. I avoid big leaps of thought. Any time a new concept is introduced, I explain it right away or tell you when I’ll explain it. Core concepts are reinforced with exercises and multiple explanations so that you can check your assumptions and make sure you’re following along.I lead with examples. Instead of writing symbol soup, my goal is to make it easy for you to visualize these concepts. I also think we learn best by being able to recall something we already know, and examples make recall easier. So when you’re trying to remember the difference between arrays and linked lists (explained in chapter 2), you can just think about getting seated for a movie. Also, at the risk of stating the obvious, I’m a visual learner.  This book is chock-full of images.The contents of the book are carefully curated.  There’s no need to write a book that covers every sorting algorithm—that’s why we have Wikipedia and Khan Academy. All the algorithms I’ve included are practical. I’ve found them useful in my job as a so ware engineer, and they provide a good foundation for more complex topics.""The book starts with simple concrete examples and then moves towards abstraction. Most books on the subject start with abstract mathematical equations (symbol soup as the author calls it) and then move towards concrete implementations (or just stay with abstract proofs). That is approach is completely backwards to me, but perhaps it works well for others.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People
"Writing and teaching about algorithms is hard. And books on algorithms tend to cater to one audience, your typical programmer who most likely has a computer science degree and took a semester on Algorithms. And these books fall in to two camps: academicky/theoretical and highly technical for job interviews. The most popular books on algorithms are not beginner friendly.Grokking Algorithms is the opposite. And caters to an unmet need: newbies and programmers who haven't touched algorithms for a long time.The book does three things well. One, it has well-drawn and simple pictures and diagrams to explain foundational algorithms such as QuickSort or Binary Search. Two, the explanations for harder algorithms such as Dijkstra's Algorithm, Greedy Algorithms, and Dynamic Programming are excellent. For a programmer who hasn't done algorithms in a long time, the author's explanations were simple, easy-to-understand, and enabled me to remember key ideas from my college days. Three, the organization of the topics enabled me to use previous chapters to understand new algorithms and emphasize key ideas that I learned early in the book. Pro-tip: read this book in order, especially if you're a newbie.Some negatives: The illustrations are hand-drawn, so sometimes it's hard to understand what the captions or diagrams are showing. If you don't know what an illustration is supposed to say, turn the book and view the illustration from a different angle. Sometimes, the words are written sideways from bottom to top. Also, the book loses focus in chapters 10 and 11. It no longer focuses on algorithms. Instead, the author writes about machine learning, encryption algorithms, and lesser known algorithms. The book could easily have stopped at chapter 9. I honestly think that these chapters were filler chapters. If you're reading this book to prepare for a job interview at a tech company, stop at chapter 9.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People

"An amazing book for non-programmers interested in learning about the world of computer science. The book might also be very useful for undergrads entering the field.The author starts with providing a general introduction on the concepts of algorithms and analyzing their time using Big O notation. The book gradually advances the reader into various concepts in algorithms to paint a clear picture throughout the book:- A few necessary data structures.- A few algorithm implementations for sorting, searching and finding the shortest path.- Graph algorithms for modeling networks.- K-NN as a gentle intro to classification problems and machine learning.The book introduces the main methods for problem-solving techniques including:- Divide and conquer: breaking a problem into smaller pieces- Approximation algorithms and NP-complete problems: greedy algorithms are used when calculating the exact solution will take too much time- Dynamic programming: optimizing a solution given a constrain by breaking it up into subproblems and solving these subproblems first (knapsack problem)Finally, the author wraps up by introducing the reader to concepts from various branches of computer science. The author provides hints on learning about each of these topics moving forwards:- Binary Trees for: B-trees, red-black trees, heaps, and splay trees.- Inverted Indexes: building search engines- Fourier transform: decomposing signals into the frequencies that make it up.- Parallel algorithms: mapReduce.- HyperLogLog and Bloom filters: probabilistic data structures and algorithms.- SHA functions: encryption and data integrity.- locality-sensitive hashing: Simhash functions where small changes only change the output slightly.- Diffie-Hellman key exchange: public private keys for secure data sharing.- Linear programming: maximizing a solution given a constraint, Simplex algorithm.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People
The book starts ok but starting from the Dijkstra’s algorithm it goes more and more sideways.

"Brandolini’s law, which states that “the amount of energy needed to refute BS is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it,” explains why there is so much BS in the world. As Uriel Fanelli put it, “an idiot can create more BS than you could ever hope to refute.”So creating BS is easy; refuting it is hard. And it is precisely this asymmetry that explains why BS persists and how it can even grow over time.So how can one hope to rid the world of increasing levels of BS? Since it’s easier to create BS than to refute it, simply refuting each new instance of BS seems like a losing battle. The better strategy is educational; if you can inoculate enough people against falling for BS in the first place, BS never gains enough traction to require costly efforts at refutation.This, in essence, is the goal of the book. The authors want to immunize you against BS, with a focus on the quantitative variety. While it’s relatively easy to identify old-school BS based on flowery language and empty rhetoric, new-school BS is more insidious and sophisticated with its use of statistics, charts, graphs, and scientific-sounding claims. This is the BS that is more persuasive, harder to refute, and ultimately more dangerous.The authors first note that while arguments based on statistical and scientific reasoning can appear intimidating, there are basic fallacies that one can look out for that do not require any advanced mathematical ability. It is rarely necessary to look into the “black box”—the authors’ term for complex equations, algorithms, or scientific processes—when the problem with BS is often the data that feeds into the black box. Recognizing that the data is biased or unrepresentative of the larger population, for example, is an easy method of spotting BS that does not require any skills in higher mathematics.The authors then take the reader on a tour of quantitative fallacies with several examples, all explained clearly and with humor. The reader will learn how to differentiate between correlation and causation, spot biased and unrepresentative data and small sample sizes, identify selection biases in samples, understand how data can be manipulated visually, and more. The reader will also learn how to properly evaluate scientific claims, and how the anti-vaxx movement is based on a single, thoroughly-debunked scientific study that massively confuses correlation with causation, among many other problems.One of my favorite chapters, chapter 8, has the authors calling BS on arguments that claim that artificial intelligence will take over the world. This has always been BS and likely always will be, as the authors demonstrate the limits of how machines are designed to “think.”The book ends with a couple summary chapters on how to spot and refute BS, and also on the difference between calling legitimate BS and becoming what the authors refer to as a “well-actually guy.” Perhaps the most important point of the book is the idea that the goal of calling BS is not to demonstrate your intelligence and puff up your ego; it’s to counter the spread of misinformation in the world and its direct and indirect consequences.Overall, I suppose that if the reader has a lot of experience with informal logic and spotting fallacies—particularly of a quantitative nature—then this book might not offer anything particularly new. Although even then the book is filled with interesting, updated examples and a ton of polemical humor which makes the book a fun read. If, on the other hand, the reader has limited experience with these concepts, this book is a must read as it shows how quantitative BS can be spotted and refuted with even the most limited of mathematical ability.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World
"The book reminds me a lot of the 1954 classic How to Lie with Statistics, which jokingly referred to itself as a “manual for swindlers.” Like that brief book, this one has a light touch, clever writing, and fun examples as it alerts us to what goes wrong if people are naïve or dishonest in how they collect, analyze, and present data.The book covers what one would expect in a guide of this type—confirmation bias, selection bias, meaningless, statistics, and common cause and other fallacies of correlation and causation. This is all standard stuff.The book gains usefulness for contemporary readers when it shows how the online world, modern graphics, Big Data, AI, and modern academic publishing are contributing to the problem of knowing what is true. The chapter on visual displays of data is particularly fun. (I have never felt comfortable reading a 3D chart or table and now I know why).Another topical chapter covers the growing concerns about replication and reproducibility. Are we publishing too many studies with false positives? Are we ignoring many that are true but do not reveal anything groundbreaking? Which ones can we trust? The authors, while defending scientific endeavor, offer some tips for spotting error and ridiculousness.The final chapter is important because it warns us to be humble and not be jerks when we point out BS. Perhaps this should have been the first chapter in case readers neglect to finish the book. I taught a critical thinking course for several decades at the university level and worried that the tools of critical thinking were too easily weaponized and might become a cudgel that a brute could yield to bully others or a means to show off. This chapter addresses that tendency.Given the book’s strong effort to tie statistical error and deception to current trends, I am disappointed it did not cover “multiplier effects.” Politicians and activists love to imagine those. “Every dollar spent on this project will pay back $2.63 in benefits.” Similarly, it barely touched on the dangers of extrapolation (“if this trend continues”) and only as a tool for debunking. Bubbles, crashes, riots, and calls for draconian policies can be triggered by thinking too far ahead of the data.  The book also does not address another current fear— that researchers on college campuses avoid topics or suppress results if they might cause offense to gun-shy undergrads or the politically correct.One drawback of the book is its occasional descent from casualness to breeziness. For example, it rather flippantly lumps climate skeptics in with people who believe in the healing power of crystals or creationism. That is dismissive and unfair given that politicians are floating proposals to address climate change that will cost many trillions of dollars. Many climate skeptics accept the evidence that the earth’s temperature rose due to human action but are not convinced that it is catastrophic or that spending trillions can do much to stop or reverse it. The authors criticize Steven Hayward’s line graph for making warming seem trivial by having the y-axis run from -10 to 110 degrees, but I sensed that his chart was satirical. It pokes fun at graphs that mark temperature increases in 5ths of a degree. Hayward’s y-axis covers the full range of temperatures most humans are likely to experience and shows that the average temperature is not pushing us anywhere near those extremes.The book could use an index.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World
"Misinformation is all around us. Sometimes, misleading information is purely an accident but other times, it is intentional in nature. False information is often fully intended to deceive, and its perpetrators have absolutely no regard for the truth. Their motive is to persuade by any means necessary and they will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. This problem is growing worse and worse every day and it is the subject of this book.Lots of people and organizations have agendas and if normal, honest means fail to achieve the intended results, then spreading false info is often the next step. For some, deception is such a common tool for them that they resort to it immediately. This book discusses several common types of deception, from cause and effect to distorted data visualization and much more.I like this book’s premise and I agree that spotting falsehoods- and using critical thinking in general- are important topics that need to be more thoroughly addressed. As I read, however, I started to feel a little pessimistic. When you think about all of the false information, fake news, deliberate deception, etc that exists all around us, it seems like an insurmountable task to try to wipe it out or at least diminish it from society. I still hold on to hope, but it is going to take a lot of education and effort to improve our collective critical thinking abilities so they we don’t so easily fall for these deceptions and this book is a good tool for this purpose.I enjoyed this book overall, but there is a section that discusses p- values that could cause some readers confusion. If you have ever worked in statistics or conducted research, you likely know what p-values are about. For everyone else, this chapter is going to go over their heads. I can understand why it was included, but it is a little much and its technical nature could cause some readers to conclude that the book and its topic are a little too complex for the average individual to understand.Still, this is an especially useful book overall and one that could benefit many members of the public who read it and absorb what it has to say. The use of deception is everywhere and we all need to do what we can to better develop our own deception detection system and help move the world in a more rational direction. Even if it means taking small baby steps at a time, it is imperative that we reverse the trend toward misinformation for a better tomorrow.

I’ve actually used it several times as a reference.After working on the front lines of a pandemic, I think EVERYONE should read this book…and would highly recommend it to anyone.

"This book provides timely information. The many processes and concepts ripe for exploitation by bullshit artists are often those that are not intuitive, or readily identifiable by the incognoscenti.One major flaw is the author's unfortunate choice not to number their references, and instead provide readers with an alphabetized list at the end wherein one is forced to make a best guess at matching the correct referenced material behind the statements made within the text. This choice of format soon gets rather annoying and is somewhat ironic, given the title of the book, and the emphasis the authors repeatedly place on proper fact checking.Note to the authors: Within the preface section, the letter ""M"" used within the acronym STEM, as per Charles Vela, and subsequently the NSF, is intended to refer to Mathematics, not Medicine.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World

Some concepts are not explained well at all but the code is fairly easy to follow if you are late beginner or early intermediate of python.

As opposed to many Machine learning books that dive deep into the theory without any practical explanation, this book explained all the ML approaches using Python and Visualization.It gives you a great deal of context and useful tools for solving all kinds of Machine Learning problems. In the deep learning chapter, you will get an excellent overview and the background to understand when and where to apply the various techniques starting from ANN, CNN to RNN. LSTM is also.

"Jordan’s “Be Data” series - with this book being the second - is a pivotal set of core curriculum that should be required by every person with a digital presence!  Be Data Literate and Be Data Driven will help to establish every person’s place at the table to talk about data more comfortably and in a more approachable manner!In today’s modern world, NO ONE can say “I’m not a Data Person” and this is why this book is so pivotal for EVERYONE to read.  As the Director of Data Literacy at a major Fortune 100 Company, I have dedicated my career to bringing the concepts of reading, understanding, working with, and gaining actionable insights from data to as many people as I can.  To do this I have repeatedly leaned on Jordan and his wonderful set of resources (Be Data Literate or one of his incredibly powerful Ted talks) and this book is now at the top of this list!Jordan has an innate ability to take very complicated concepts that can be polarizing to a general audience and makes them approachable in a manner that is engaging and compelling.  This simplification makes the topics engaging for everyone, regardless of your education, experience, or background knowledge around data/math/statistics, and is unmatched in the world of technical writing.We all have a responsibility, whether at work or in our local communities, to leverage our knowledge, skills, abilities, and tools to improve the lives of others.  While reading this book we can understand how to find our path on this journey - even if we don’t realize it’s a journey we are on.  He helps us understand that in today’s digital world - we are ALL data people - and in order to keep up with the world around us we must first understand it and then we can learn to harness it to improve our careers, the companies we work for, and for the lives of others around us.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Be Data Driven: How Organizations Can Harness the Power of Data

"After reading Jordan's first book Be Data Literate, I wasn't sure what perspective he would bring to this next one as he really covered off everything you need to know about data skills in the first book. But I was wrong.This book approaches it from the other super important view, Your Organisation. As a consultant, I work daily with executives, directors and managers who are trying (and in a lot of ways failing) to build the data-driven nature of their organisation. Since reading this, I have borrowed several ideas, methodologies and strategies from this book to feed into my work. Essentially THIS BOOK HAS BEEN SO HELPFUL!!!I think people in data forget that building a data-driven organisation or culture isn't just about your own skills, but setting the right structure and strategy in the organisation. Jordan goes through all of these things in detail and drives home every point you need to think about to get well on your way. I think the one thing he might be able to bring to his next book is some graphics/ frameworks to bring these concepts together, but maybe that is better just left to us expensive consultants who take his ideas, build a nice infographic from it and sell it for thousands of dollars ;)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Be Data Driven: How Organizations Can Harness the Power of Data
"good book, but....no data sets to work with. Seems critical for a source code heavy book (ie almost every chapter has pages of code). We would prefer not to scan, then try to run the code ourselves. Read the appendix first at that seems to be where the theory is then go back to the chapters for practical work. Borrowed this book from the library....its really expensive otherwiseupdate: OK --kept reading, and paying overdue fines at the library, so I bought the book. Really worth the read if you're serious about focusing on marketing data science. Great starting read for technical marketers who want to do something in this field.Glad the code samples are now available. Will have to test and see. One thing I noticed about the content. Every time something got interesting Prof. Miller would quote a reference for further reading (ie. details). That's sort of OK, but leaves me wanting and having to go dig elsewhere. Suggestion: one more paragraph for such situations would put my curiosity at rest. A lot of content around product development, positioning, recommending, but a little light on broader examples - It might be helpful to describe a broader range of techniques (ie. list them), then drill down on one or two. It just seems too narrow, like drinking from a straw when really a funnel is needed with the huge alternatives.

"First, this is an excellent book. Why 4 stars? It presupposes a fair amount of knowledge of R, Python and the analytic techniques used for the data science approach of marketing analytics. Newbies will struggle with the concepts in this book. It dives right into the code, the techniques, and the statistical measures used in the first example of how Miller made the decision of which mobile company to use after a move based on 16 product profiles using linear models and conjoint analysis. (a brief explanation of the sum contrasts and fitted regression coefficient follows with code for R and Python). In many of the chapters, there are appendices that have additional descriptions of statistical techniques and references.That being said, this is an excellent reference for programmers, statisticians, modelers, marketers and data scientists. Props to Miller for calling out in the intro the definition of data science, ""the new statistics, a blending of modeling techniques, information technology, and business savvy"" while also reminding readers that it doesn't mean abandoning scientific research, surveys, inference, or primary data collection. Not all of the information that we need or want is available.The pros: readers familiar with how to program in R or Python will be able to follow along. All the sample code tested have been correct so far. Python scripts are notoriously problematic in books because of the spacing requirements, but all those tested have worked. Since it's focused on using Python and R (both of which are free and have robust user communities), people who are familiar with the analytic techniques but who want to learn to apply it can do so without having to pay for software.Miller also includes concepts of data visualizations (often done through R, which has a number of great packages he references), data base systems and data preparation, all of which are major components of being able to efficiently answer the question. Data curation is often a huge undertaking that non-database people misunderstand.To get a sense of the comprehensiveness of the appendices, in the marketing data source appendix B, Miller also describes options for sampling (simple random, convenience, probability samples, types of sampling frame, cluster sampling, adaptive sampling, on-line surveys, telephone surveys, random-digit dial, and discusses some of the pros and cons of each (with words, not formulas). He also discusses the concept of a panel sample and the accuracy of the panel in being able to generalize the responses back to the population. The one discussion area that is missed when he asks "" How large a ample is needed to obtain useful information?"" is a power calculation - looking at what is the smallest needed sample to detect a difference in what measure is being used (improvement on an indicator/survey question; differences between specific populations; or to determine how wide a standard error is around the point estimate to see  what a detectable difference would be.Overall, though, it's got a lot of great information. It's dense and takes time to work through the examples and code (especially for someone like me who is just an R and Python tinkerer without a ton of expertise in those languages), but is a good primer that presents the concepts in a neutral way, allowing the data scientist to make up their own mind about how to approach the situation.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Marketing Data Science: Modeling Techniques in Predictive Analytics with R and Python (FT Press Analytics)
"This is a difficult book to review, and I struggled with it a bit. On one hand, it is well written with good use of hypothetical and relevant examples (.e.g Amazon, AT&T). On the other hand, it reads like a programming class - lectures and all, which can be dense and difficult to glean information from - not exactly the rapid fire approach many data scientists I work with/am use (caveat: I'm in life sciences).Pros:-Wealth of information - book is dense-Covers topics based on marketing not programming approaches (e.g. Recommending Products with approaches rather than Building Network Diagrams with marketing examples of how to use this technique)-Uses my two favorite languages - R & Python - very common and can be applied to modeling, charting and analytics more readily than other languages - they work well together - Python for building interfaces and specific R packages for doing the deep statistical/data crunching & visualization/presentation (at least that is how I use them)-Plenty of example code that can be readily used - sample data described in text available for download-I like that there is a list of Tables in the front of the book - makes it easy to rapidly find the right examplesCons:-This book is difficult to go through - you need to be comfortable with both R and Python-Book also assumes familiarity with common statistical/analytical approachesBottom line: as this book does not cover fundamentals of any of the core subjects (marketing, Python, R, Predictive Analytics) my gut is that to approach this topic you would be better served learning first predictive analytics and marketing concepts prior to this book being of full utility.

"There is a lot of good information in this book, but I find it poorly organized and presented.It's hard to figure out the best audience for this book, and I think when you imagine it as a textbook in a specific degree program, where the instructor would know exactly the prerequisite classes taken by the students coming into the class, then it starts to make sense. Ideas toward the front of the book are not properly introduced and code is thrown at the reader without much in the way of explanation. In the context of a class, the instructor could smooth out these rough edges and likely deliver a coherent educational experience. But as a standalone learning experience, this is rough going.(I'm sure it's relevant what my own background is, which is completely comfortable with predictive analytics and programming, but ignorant of the specific way that ""marketing"" folks look at the world.)I find the book very strangely organized in that Appendix A, ""Data Science Methods"", is, well, relegated to an appendix, rather than being a central part of the flow of the book. It's a really good chapter!There is some tremendously useful code presented in this book, but again, the way that it's presented will make it of limited utility to those who do not have a guide in the form of a professor teaching a class or who do not have sufficient background to ramp up to the ideas presented.I am also not fond of the production qualities of the book, e.g:1. The paper is overly thin, so you can see the text on the other side of the page, which just makes reading harder to my mind.2. The code is presented with this horrible gray background. Black text on a  gray background (I dunno, maybe 30% gray) is not good contrast. So the code ends up being unnecessarily difficult to read.3. That this was created using LaTeX is obvious to me. Not because the typesetting is problematic, but because of the front matter, with the separate listings of Figures, Tables, and Exhibits. LaTeX makes producing these listings easy, but just because you can produce them doesn't mean you should. They feel anachronistic and strange.The fact that all the code and underlying data is available on the web is amazing, so for some folks, the difficult presentation will be worth slogging through to see the examples.

Here is a summary of its problems:* Spelling, grammatical, fluency and literacy errors throughout - sometimes making it difficult to understand what the authors are saying* Rather than explain content, the authors regularly refer to other sources of information.  They do this so frequently that after reading about a particular topic, you are left with no new knowledge on the subject matter.* The authors shy away from defining subjects.  For example, they offer no clear definition of ""artificial intelligence,"" ""machine learning,"" or ""deep learning"" in the chapters in which they are covered.  Instead, they repeatedly say ""there is no consensus on definitions for this term.""  While that may be true, there must still be some definition that they offer in order to work from.* While offering no definitions on terms such as those in the bullet above, there are definitions of those terms in the textbook's glossary.  However, those definitions seem to have come from yet another source, as they do not match up with the definitions discussed in the chapters.This is a disappointing textbook, particularly for one that is in its 11th edition.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Analytics, Data Science, & Artificial Intelligence: Systems for Decision Support"

"Power BI is an incredible analytical and visualization tool, but if your reports require anything beyond basic statistical or geospatial analyses, use very large datasets or incorporate machine learning models, then integrating R or Python into Power BI is a must.  This book provides a clear, well-written and beautifully organized roadmap for successfully integrating R or Python into Power BI in a very wide variety of scenarios, many of which I've not seen addressed elsewhere.  The author does a nice job clearly calling out best practices and cautionary notes.For those deciding between Python and R, each topic addressed includes both Python and R sections making it easy to compare approaches and specific code between the two.  Many of the topics in the book are quite advanced, but they are very well-explained step-by-step with downloadable code, sample datasets, and extensive screenshot and illustrations.  Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Extending Power BI with Python and R: Ingest, transform, enrich, and visualize data using the power of analytical languages"

"I am very happy to give my review for Luca Zavarella’s book Extending Power BI with Python and R. If you’re looking to extend your data analyst skills with R and Python, this is the book for you. The first thing that jumps out is that the book is very well organized and its various concepts throughout are clearly defined and easily explained. The chapters also logically flow very well together; from beginning with setting up your environment and loading your data, to the end of creating visualizations. Personally, my two favorite chapters were “Loading Large Datasets beyond the Available RAM in Power BI” and “Calling External APIs to Enrich your Data”. Learning about Dask and Tidyverse were some great skills to add to my knowledge of Power BI. The explanation about web services was very well written too. The only thing I would have liked to have seen a little more on was maybe having some review questions at the end of each chapter to test the readers understanding of what you read. Not a deal breaker though as there is a summary at the end of each chapter which serves as a good substitute. A glossary at the back of the book providing definition of important terms would have been nice too as it would provide readers a better understanding of some of the important concepts. Overall, the book was a great read and from front to back you can really tell the author took a lot of time with explaining its various complex topics in a way understandable to an audience with a wide range of BI knowledge. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Luca’s book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to further extend their data analyst career by learning Python and R in Power BI.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Extending Power BI with Python and R: Ingest, transform, enrich, and visualize data using the power of analytical languages"
"As a data scientist I have to use several different tools, technologies, platforms, languages to analyze complex & large datasets. One of the main challenges most companies face is providing single source of truth for data and utilizing the data semantic layer for both BI & ML. That's a big gap, that's why this is a great book that attempts to plug that gap. You can use Power BI to extract, transform and visualize the data and Python/R for advanced analytics. Unfortunately official Microsoft documentation is very lacking on this topic but this book goes in-depth in showing several use cases on how you can utilize Python & R in Power BI.This is definitely not a book for beginner Power BI users and assumes that you already have experience with Python & R. The author does provide high-level overview of the technical topics of ML before showing how to do it, but dont expect a thorough discussion. If you currently use Power BI and are looking to expand your tool chest, I would recommend the book.As mentioned above, you should have experience with ML and understand the implications of deploying it in Power BI directly. As a data scientist, I wouldn't recommend deploying models in Power BI and the author mentions that as well, BUT I definitely see the use cases where you just want to create a POC for the end-users.Using Python & R in Power BI comes with severe limitations and the author mentions those but wish he had highlighted those more so analysts can evaluate the pros/cons.Overall, the book is very thorough and I will definitely be using it as a reference in my future projects.-S.Pawar | PawarBI",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Extending Power BI with Python and R: Ingest, transform, enrich, and visualize data using the power of analytical languages"

I learned not only why there are multiple choices and versions of each language, but when to consider using different implementations of R or Python for data transformation, analysis and advanced visualization. Beginners will have a clear understanding about how R and Python fit into the Power BI ecosystem and experienced analysts will have a useful set of tools to take their solutions to the next level, with several examples and patterns to follow.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Extending Power BI with Python and R: Ingest, transform, enrich, and visualize data using the power of analytical languages"
"This book stood out for me for a couple of reasons:1. Many books just show the mechanics of extending Power BI with Python/R but Luca Zavarelli does not just show the mechanics of using Python or R with Power BI; he actually explains those mechanics with thorough examples and delves into the concepts in great depth.2. There are some parts of the Python/R eco-system (e.g. regex) which are considered by some authors to be mundane when using those programming languages for Power BI. In this book, Luca leaves no stone unturned: he touches every concept in details, including those deemed mundane. This book is one of the most complete books I've read on the Power BI + Python/R combo.I highly recommend this book for analysts, especially those coming from a Python/R background.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Extending Power BI with Python and R: Ingest, transform, enrich, and visualize data using the power of analytical languages"

"This is an excellent introductory overview to Data Science. I have been a programmer since 1978, and one of the first languages I learned was SAS. I used SAS to analyze a multitude of problems, and also used it to convert data from one format to another (ETL type functions). I kind-of, sort-of realized I morphed into a data scientist through the years, but never had a overall view of the subject. This book supplies the framework I've been missing. It's easy for a programmer to lose the forest for the trees, and count me in, as a member of that group. This book clearly outlines the difference between data engineer and data scientist and the types of tools and activities within each domain. It addresses the why and the what, given various scenarios. It wisely stops short of giving explicit coding examples for most topics, meaning the how, in terms of coding, is frequently not present. However, to do that, in my opinion, would take at least another book. Make no mistake, there are coding examples, links to useful resources and good chapters on Python and R. But what helped me the most, was an outstanding view of the field of data science. Well written and easily accessible. I have the Kindle version, and it looks good on my laptop.

"Lillian Pierson has written a remarkable book on one count (explaining Data Science) and a not so great one on another count (actually teaching the methods of Data Science).  Based on the latter the usual audience of the “For Dummies” series may be somewhat disappointed.After studying this book, you will not have developed the adequate proficiency to undertake any of the quantitative, programming, or spatial visualization methods the author presents.  This is not surprising.  You won’t readily pick up the entire fields of probability, regressions, and Monte Carlo simulation in the barely 20 pages that the author assigns to this matter.  Similarly, you won’t be able to program much if anything by reading the 20 pages chapter on either Python or R.  As you know, there are entire For Dummies books written on many of those subjects separately.  And, many of those actually struggle to cover one single field adequately.  For instance, in my view the “R for Dummies” and “Probability for Dummies” are mediocre (after studying them I rated both of them a 3).  So, if others could not well cover R over 350 pages, what chance would Pierson have to cover it adequately in 20 pages.However, this is not to say that this book does not have much value.  It really does.  And, that is in defining what Data Science is, in exploring all its aspects, in differentiating between Data Engineers and Data Scientists, in surveying practical solutions of how many fields are currently using Data Science and how, and in informing you what exists out there.Additionally, some of the chapters are surprisingly strong (relative to some of the quick overview of specific subjects as demonstrated by other chapters).  This includes many chapters near the end.  Chapter 19 on Environmental Data Science is excellent.  You can tell this is one of the author’s subspecialties.  Chapter 20 on Data Science for driving E-Commerce is also excellent.  The author has a surprisingly broad and deep culture on this specific topic.  The Part of Tens is very good.  Sometimes within the Dummies Series, the Part of Tens are wasted fillers mandated by the For Dummies format.  This is not the case here, as this section is very informative with many excellent free data sources and data tools.In summary, the book is excellent in defining what Data Science is.  It is not always that good at teaching how to practice Data Science.  As indicated above, this is no fault of the author. You can’t possibly teach a dozen complex mathematical disciplines, computer programs, and data visualization techniques in 350 lightly written pages.  As mentioned, it is already remarkable that in that small pace she could survey and define so well all those disciplines (and give you a rudimentary idea of how to practice those).The book can be used in many different ways.For many readers it may serve as a pretty good benchmark of where they stand.  If one is reading this book, it is not unlikely that you are already half way there to being a Data Scientist.  This book will clearly spell out what are the skills you already have that qualify you as a Data Scientist, and what skill you are still missing to be a full fledged one.This book can serve as an excellent stepping stone to further study many aspects of this fascinating field.  Pierson has a very deep and broad culture in Data Science.  She refers to tons of stuff, including very powerful open source web based data visualization and data analysis software that most people (even quants themselves) may have never heard off.  She also defines well how to use certain computer programs and what they can do for you.  Thus, if you are hesitating between learning R or Python, she will provide much valid information on the subject to facilitate your decision.  In other words, Pierson provides an excellent survey of what exists out there, and what fields, methods, or programs are out there that you could study next.  That alone is a huge value and is the main value of the book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science For Dummies

"I’ve been meaning to review this book for a while. Last year I got laid off from my startup and found myself feeling anxious as I haven’t had to look for a job for several years. I bought this book along with two others, but this was the only one I really spent time on. The first third of this book provides specific information about companies along with example problems. The last two thirds are problem solutions with explanations. I found everything valuable. I didn’t write out complete solutions for most of her example problems. If I thought it was obvious I skipped it, but whatever you do don’t skip reading the solution. It’s here where you can read about ways of solving the problem that didn’t occur to you. For example, if you want to know if two binary trees are identical you can verify this by comparing their preorder and inorder traversals. The only gaps were discrete math and heaps. Heaps appeared frequently in sample questions on Glassdoor. I pulled an old data structures book out to re-read about heaps, but I was never explicitly asked about them during my job search though I did mention them a couple times as possible ways to maintain a priority queue.Information about the companies was very relevant as I live in the Bay Area. I wish I had heeded her admonition about discrete math for Google because I was unprepared for these questions. I would have read the math if it was in the book, but since I haven’t used that math ever in a job I skipped it. During the interview I was able to solve the math problems except I needed basic definitions and one or two hints. For Amazon it was good to know there’s a “bar raiser” because it was obvious when I met the interviewer who wrote out a really hard problem right off the bat and wanted a linear time algorithm. I was speechless for five minutes, but managed to reduce the problem enough where the solution suddenly came to me. I think I would have been unnerved by the question if I didn’t know about this type of interviewer that she writes about. I wish she also covered Twitter and LinkedIn.The book doesn’t talk enough about applying for jobs. I do wish she wrote about job offer contingencies as my first job offer was from a startup who told me it expires in 24 hours. This in turn caused other recruiters to panic. While in the end I got a good job, all in all I hope I’m not forced to do this again anytime soon. I’m just glad I had this book at my side. It was indispensable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions
"While this book is meant for interview practice, I would recommend you still read it just for fun if you're into algorithms.I've always believed that there's no ""crack"" to coding interviews; it's just a matter of whether you can code or not (well, at least at those sane companies not filling up school buses with golf balls). And that requires practice. Lots of practice. Which is why I spent all my free time working out problems on Hackerrank. For me, this went well . . . for a while.But there comes a point at which you get stuck. I remember working on some hackerrank problems in the medium to hard difficulty which I would not be able to proceed for weeks and weeks. No amount of googling for information, discussion boards or stack overflow threads paint a complete picture to help you when you're stuck.After countless such occasions and failing a few interviews, I gave in and bought this book. After all it was $20 - the cost of an uber to work.Now, I wish I had bought this sooner!Within reading the first two chapters I've already learnt so much about how to think about coding problems. There's also a nice collections of custom data structures at the end of the book. I've swiped some data structures straight out of this book and use them in my day-to-day life too.Gayle has done a tremendous job of using words to explain how that weird gooey gel inside your head moves like when problem-solving. She deconstructs every approach to tackle a problem into atomic pieces. She goes into great depth about alternative designs, tradeoffs and runtime complexity. She talks about visualizing recursive calls as trees, thinking about BUD*, amortized analysis of ArrayList and much more. The great thing is that Gayle goes into copious amounts of details for each solution - she talks about how to start from a brute force solutions and optimize each component one-by-one and talks about tradeoffs in approaches.Overall, I think this a very helpful book. I would recommend you begin reading this book immediately after your first course on Algorithms. It will certainly help drill down the concepts and help strengthen your fundamentals.*BUD is a special term the author uses to describe strategies to optimize solutions",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions
"The main reason I bought the book is that it closely reflects the status quo of the technical interviews in large tech companies. You probably can do 1000 problems on leetcode in several months and achieve better results. But this book can be done in maybe half of the time and yet does a decent sampling of the typical problems.I have both the 5th edition and the 6th edition. I bought 2 editions because the 6th edition has more problems and is better organized.Four stars instead of five for two reasons.First is about what the book is promoting. The current interview process is far from being perfect. For many of the problems, unless you know the solutions beforehand, there is no way you can code up a decent one within an hour. Some of the problems were even research subjects for years before an optimal solution was found. The book mentions an example, a good candidate whom the author knows very well but just cannot pass the coding interviews. As the author explains, large tech companies can afford false negatives. How to fix the problem? Read the book back and forth and do the problems several times. Then a candidate will greatly increase the chance of landing a good job. But the question is: Will anyone who aces on interview problems necessarily perform well on the job? Will this person necessarily be a good engineer? I do not know. There are definitely false positives too. I am guessing the assumption is that the coding problems we do nowadays on the interviews somehow achieve minimal number of false positives. But I doubt there are actually numbers supporting that claim.The second reason for a star less is the lack of rigorousness. Some of the problems are presented unclear. I have to go to the solution part to figure out what a problem actually means. Some of the solutions are not straightforward. For example, there is a problem calls for topological sort. However, none of the solutions given uses breadth-first search. Why? Some of the solutions have wrong analysis. For example, the subtree checking problem. One solution reduces the problem to checking for substrings. The Java method is String.indexOf(). The author claims the time complexity is O(m+n), which I believe for Java is actually O(mn).Overall this is good book for preparing for coding interviews. A bit disappointed about what has become of the technical interviews nowadays.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions
If you are a starting or seasoned developer going through gut-wrenching process of preparing for the current tech interview process this is probably one of the best resources in terms of letting you know that your experience or inexperience doesn't matter as long as you can solve the problems in this book.  The author amusingly states that the interviewers are trying to see how you approach problems that 'you've never seen before' and then shows you 189 of the most common ones.  It is significantly likely that although your coding interview with a FAANG-like company may not have of these problems exactly it will be some flavor of one or more of them.  You will also likely have to solve them under time constraints that will likely not allow you to think through them as if you had never seen them before while the interviewer is waiting for your answer so repetitive practice is key.  Know that your competition for these interviews could be spending hundreds of hours practicing the types of problems in this book while you may be doing useful work so you may have to take significant time out of your schedule to practice to be competitive.  What that says about those who have successfully or unsuccessfully navigated the tech interview process is unclear.  I suppose the idea is for technology companies to have a consistent interview process although a consistently bad interview process may miss more candidates than an inconsistently good one.  But this is the system we are currently stuck with so I guess that you should play along until the tech companies evolve and a better technical interview process comes along.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions
"First, I have no idea why Silicon Valley is obsessed with these interviews. Is it just that they couldn't figure anything else out? These questions are a terrible indicator of how good of a programmer you are. My software company, outside the valley, has interviews that actually relate to the job, and we get confused candidates because they've practiced all these algorithm and data structure problems and little else. Anyway, it's what we have and that's what the book is geared towards. It's a decent book. I like to have an ""offline"" thing to supplement my online training, and this fills that void. Unfortunately, it's not without its flaws. It needs a bit of a math review of the commutative property and logs, otherwise understanding that chapter is going to be difficult. It has an occasional ""easily proved"" or ""easily disproved"" type of verbiage which is never backed up. (This is something I see in far too many books.) The biggest flaw of the book is you can't ask clarifying questions about a problem, which you will most definitely need to do at an interview. That's more of a flaw of the format rather than the author. I'm not going to go into details of each of the problems, because I don't want to give anything away, but I remember doing the first problem and wondering why in the world they were suggesting doing a quicksort or other n log n algorithm on a string which is at most 26 characters.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions
"I was never a smart student in the classroom. However, I was lucky to get selected to the best Engineering college in the country, where only top 300 maths stream students from the whole country yearly get selected to the national University Program. I passed out in 2006, but was not selected to the CSE program, because only the smarted 50 was chosen. Since then I never thought I will ever learn programming, or I could never work in the lucrative Software Field. However later after the Uni, I developed an interest in learning Programming for my Living, and since then I kept learning ever since, failing at some places, never giving up, growing up with some confidence...But was a tough Journey. Trying many courses, working every day after hours, for 11 years continuously working hard generally more than 12 hours at average on this field, and Have read, and followed a lot of books, nothing truly makes me confident. I realized, somewhere I have missed some fundamentals, some patterns of thinking, which kept me scared and unconfident, keeping a doubt about my fundamental expertise, in a far unrecognize place of my heart.Recently I got an interview call to work as a Google Contractor, which really impressed me. Again I found out, getting my self-prepared for such a challenge, I am not yet ready. I was feeling, I am missing some way of thinking. I got an Amazon interview. One of my friends recommend me this book, But by that I have already read, enough about the feedback for the book. I have my second interview for Amazon today, in other few hours. I am still not confident about Programming because I could not stay enough with the Book. However, I already have the feeling that this book is the most enlightening book, if you are like me, not very confident, not very super smart and still are planning to crack a coding interview with some smart answers.

"Machine learning solutions architect handbook by David Ping is a must read for all levels of data scientist, ML engineers and data science/analytics executives. This book covers the length and breadth of building and operationalizing ML models with open source tools and also AWS AI services. Though this book covers the ML environment in AWS, it covers various facets of ML model building, deployment, maintenance and governance.I feel this book serves various personas in AI/ML domain:1.Data scientists could expand their knowledge on how to train and serve large scale models.2.ML engineers/solution architects could expand their knowledge on Kubernetes & AWS features to build enterprise scale data science/ML platforms.3.Data science/analytics leaders could learn about various AI/ML use cases, AWS AI services and get familiarized with various AWS tools in AI/ML architecture.This book not only provides tutorials for in-depth understanding of the concepts but also is easy to understand if one wants to get a high level overview.

"If you're an engineer who's looking for implementation details around the topics in this book, this isn't that book. It is a however a good guide at a 'high-level' topic details. It works as a good template to fact check on topics and points that would help you dig deeper into topics outside of the book from a data architecture perspective.

"I thought this book would help me understand how to do application projects, as it is one instance of a data project, and the book indeed lists it as such.Having skimmed through the whole book in about 30 minutes (which, in my experience, means that there is nothing very concrete in a book to think about; if the book packs a lot of ideas, it takes days of month to read and understand it), I concluded that this book is more like a checklist of high-level topics (such as ""don't forget about authentification!"", which, in my opinion, is quite obvious) that you should consider when doing aforementioned projects. And it doesn't give any concrete example of how you can do any of the points the author mentions, their drawbacks or anything like that.And I haven't found any example (maybe there are a few and I missed them), and it only exacerbates the problem of the lack of details.So, I was hoping for a much more practical book, rather than high-level rant.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Foundations for Architecting Data Solutions: Managing Successful Data Projects

"This compendium was due. On the one hand it provides an overview on the different approaches and techniques to digitalize chemistry. On the other hand it sets a clear vision for the future of chemistry: a radical new way to think the science of the matter everything is made from. It should be taught to every student that take the endeavor to become a chemist these days. With over 200 code examples it is bit hard to read for chemists, so python experience is necessary. On the other hand the theoretical introduction to the chemistry use cases are very short so that data scientists will jsut get a brief understanding of the subject.

"Broad scope and current.  This is the book for anyone looking to see the range of available tools (from machine learning to d3.js) for data science.  She is better than most authors at the intro stage of every topic -- for example, why do I care about reducing dimensionality? How to predict groupings within a dataset?  One reviewer said that this book does not get much into implementation of the concepts.  That is true, but then how could you in less than 400 pages?  Entire books are written on just one topic, such as time series prediction models.  The key for beginners and intermediate data science practitioners is to fully understand options before spending weeks or months going down a rabbit hole (wrong model).  I can say this with some regret because I wasted a lot of my own time in a steel demand prediction project a few years back.  Had I been better acquainted with options, I probably would have completed it in half the time.

"I bought the Kindle version of this book a few days ago when it had been discounted. While I had read some books on data science before and have a somewhat solid understanding of statistics, I thought that this book might be a refreshing departure of the more dry texts based on the overall positive reviews.Sadly, this wasn't so. Admittedly, I only made it through the first 25% of the book before I couldn't get myself to continue. I found myself spending more time marking up mistakes in the book than actually reading. Even the simplest of concepts like singular value decomposition (SVD) is full of errors; matrices are being called vectors, the order of matrix multiplication is displayed incorrectly, etc.Everybody makes mistakes, and this wouldn't be such a deal breaker if the rest of the book up to here contained useful information. To put it in terms of data science, if you had to perform data reduction on Part I of the book, the eigenvalue would be zero, yet this would be a good predictor for the next 5%. There's absolutely nothing in the first part that would be worth keeping if I was the technical editor.

Overall, terrific read.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values
"I must admit that I was taken by surprise by the contents of Brian Christian’s recent book, The Alignment Problem. The book came out in 2020 and made quite a splash among the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine intelligence community. Much of the public, including myself, had been made aware of “the alignment problem” by Nick Bostrom’s book, Superintelligence, or the writings of people such as MIT physicist, Max Tegmark. In fact, in my case, it was the conundrum of the alignment problem that spurred me to write my science fiction novel, Ezekiel’s Brain. Simply put, the alignment problem in the AI world is the question of how you create a superintelligent AI that is “friendly,” i.e., helpful rather than dangerous, to humanity.  It’s such a difficult question that, in my novel, Ezekiel’s Brain, the creators of the superintelligent AI fail, and the result is disastrous for the human race.  What I was expecting from Brian Christian’s book was another description of the nightmare scenarios of the kind I wrote about in my novel, and experts such as Bostrom and Tegmark talk about in their writings. That wasn’t what The Alignment Problem was about… or at least not what it was mostly about.Christian gives some detailed accounts of disastrous results applying the most sophisticated AI learning algorithms to actual human situations. Some of these are well-known, such as attempts to censor social media content, or to produce an algorithm that aided judges in criminal sentencing, or to develop screening tools for employment selection. Training AIs using data on human decisions simply amplified the biases, including gender, racial and ideological, we humans use to make our decisions. These were instances of AIs performing in a way that was more harmful than helpful to humans, and they were results of which I had previously only been vaguely aware. Although they were not the kind of misalignment that I was concerned with and had prompted me to buy the book, they expanded my concept of alignment considerably.Instead of providing nightmare scenarios of the danger of superintelligent AIs that are not aligned with what is best for humanity, the bulk of Christian’s book provides an exquisite history, up to the present, of the efforts of the AI community to define how machines can learn, what they are learning and what they ought to be learning, and how to identify whether the progress being made is bringing AIs in closer alignment with what humans want from them. What was most surprising and gratifying to me, as a psychologist, was how much this effort is entwined with progress in understanding how people learn and what affects that learning process.Christian writes his book like a good mystery, but rather than following a narrow plot, the breadth of inquiry is extraordinary. Even a psychologist, such as myself, learned about findings in psychology and learning and child development of which I was unaware. How computer scientists who develop AI use psychological findings to open up new avenues in machine learning is fascinating to hear about. The collaborations are thrilling, and both psychologists and AI researchers who are not aware of how much is happening on this front should read Christian’s book to get an idea of how exciting an important this area of research is becoming.Although I have some background related to psychology, AI, and the alignment problem, this book is written for the non-expert, and the interested layperson can easily understand it and bring their knowledge of the subject up to date. I found it one of the most captivating and informative books I have read in the last several years, and I recommend it for everyone for whom this topic sparks an interest.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values

"The Alignment Problem should be read, absorbed and should incite each of us to considered carefully the problems we see already in popularized AI as opposed to what real AI is about. I think Brian Christian's message is that we no longer have the luxury of relying upon unknown persons and institutions to do what is best for all of us. That is simply an irrational and impossible tenet to hold on to. The time for spectating is over. We've already learned there is harm done  to our species through social media. Our responsibility is to get ahead of unsolicited AI implementation and its effects on our lives. To do this, we have to learn what real AI entails. Brian Christian's The Alignment Problem does require some mental effort on the part of the reader. You will be exposed to key ideas you need to participate in current and future debates on real AI.

"I have to admit: it took me quite a while to finish this book. In its introduction of the different types of machine learning: how they came to be, how they were shaped to perform, and how they fall short, The Alignment Problem often felt like a bit of a drag, dwelling a little too much on the backstory of AI's evolutionary phases and distracting the reader from its very explanation of each machine learning model's logic and shortcomings.Bulk of the discussion of machine learning's alignment with human values was concentrated in the last 30 or so pages of the book, and I wish the author allocated more space for it. While giving up a bit of history's space in favor of alignment's would have been welcome, the explanations of AI's inner workings themselves were good.The book extensively detailed how the shaping of rewards allows AI to accomplish immediate tasks asked of them. Imitation, reinforcement, or sheer feedback: the numerous reward models discussed had me thinking of ways to use them in an organization to shape the behavior of people (!) - not even machines. Through understanding how strategic and unambiguous our instructions and how explicit our intuitions and intentions must be to train programs, maybe we can communicate with and develop people just a little bit better. And for that twist alone, The Alignment Problem is worth slowly chipping at.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values

"Not much to add to previous reviews. A fascinating, easy to read summary of efforts to understand and control how AI ""agents"" learn, informed by how the human brain develops and works. We still have an incomplete understanding of the latter, so it stands to reason there will be surprises in how machines learn and ways this can go awry. As Christian explains, this is proving to be the case and what just a few years ago were Hollywood doomsday scenarios like SkyNet in the Terminator movies - when machines become malevolent and work counter to human interests - have emerged as serious, genuine concerns and a rapidly expanding area of AI and machine learning research. Machine learning, coupled with advances in computer power, is expanding exponentially in capability and practitioners are increasingly worried about what is going on these ""black boxes"". I plan to re-read the book, to better understand the various facets of this. Best book I've read in awhile. THAT ALL BEING SAID, the Kindle version is a MESS!

"I am a voracious reader, or should I say, listener because nowadays, I first listen to books which may be of interest. More often than not I find that popular business and even science books are large in volume but thin in content.The big exception is Brian Christian’s book “The Alignment Problem”, 1st Edition (October 6, 2020). Briefly, Christian defines the alignment problem as arising from our imprecise or incomplete instructions to artificial intelligence which may result in a potentially catastrophic divergence from what we really want and what AI actually does.  Alignment ensures that models capture our norms and values so that they implement what we mean, intend and want.Christian’s narrative, always compelling and interesting, opens up new insights on every page even if you are generally familiar with the field. The book extends over 334 pages and is then followed by an 117 page notes and bibliography section. In other words, this huge accomplishment of a book is of value to the academic researcher in AI, ethicists and legal scholars, the advanced analytics practitioner and their managers, and an interested lay audience. It should be noted that the book is also of particular interest to physicians who are currently developing or using AI algorithms for diagnosis or patient management.Artificial intelligence is currently on the top of its own hype cycle again. In contrast to previous decades we now see an avalanche of real world applications covering up the potential for failure: obvious, patent, and potentially fixable, on one hand,  and latent, hidden or lurking, waiting to trigger catastrophe, on the other hand. Raising awareness now will help avoid serious mistakes.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values
Very good,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Digital Mindset: What It Really Takes to Thrive in the Age of Data, Algorithms, and AI"
"The ""Digital Mindset"" attempts to make sense of the vast implications of a whole new paradigm of work, decisions, perspectives, definitions, relationships, obligations, and security; brought about by the digital context in our age. Whereas the authors emphasize “upskilling” throughout the text, they suggest that one ought to only master 30% of the key competencies to help ask relevant questions and make relevant direction toward key decisions in the first place. The book combines basic and advanced conversations into important themes entwined with well-researched case studies. They discuss key notions of data and analytics, human interaction with artificial intelligence (AI), digital presence, privacy and security. This is so far the best resource for understanding ""Digital Transformation"" especially Chapter 7 where they discuss ""leading as transitioning"".  They not only urge leaders to accept and embrace digital-driven change, but to also design and align systems and processes to integrate the right digital tools as we transition to digitization. This is a huge resource for the complete tipping point of paradigms that our generation is only starting to understand. This is an important digital transformation reference book because of its generous and careful illustrations carefully annexed. I highly recommend this book for all leaders in every field globally. Respect!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Digital Mindset: What It Really Takes to Thrive in the Age of Data, Algorithms, and AI"

"I have read this book three times, given how imporrtant ""data"" and their associated technologies are for our lives today.  The authors use accessible language (e.g.,not all jargon) and offer much information and commentary, but I wish they focused more on critical techniques rather than go into painstaking details on what often seem to be so many peripheral issues or concerns.Are we living in an information regime that relies on masses of data - as quantifiable, accessible, manipulable, and fungible  - rather than good science?  If so, why?  And what are its costs. They may agree, and believe that in these 300 pages they have made the case.  I cannot be sure, and feel lost among the aforementiond ""trees.""

"I have just finished reading ""How Data Happened"" by Chris Wiggins and Matthew L. Jones. Highly recommend this book as it provides an insightful look into the history and implications of data and data-driven decision making in our data-centric world. One aspect I hadn't fully appreciated is the pivot in AI and machine learning from an initial focus on algorithms—which often led to AI winters due to limited data and computational resources—to the later utilization of ""big data"" and the subsequent surge in computational capacities that fuel today's AI advancements. The authors also portray the interplay of academia and corporations and the tensions and symmetries that have emerged. The most engaging discussions delve into the historical evolution of data's complex relationship with societal issues, focusing on bias, power, and equity.",5.0 out of 5 stars,How Data Happened: A History from the Age of Reason to the Age of Algorithms

Disappointing, since it is a fascinating subject, and I wished the authors had told the story in their own voice.",2.0 out of 5 stars,How Data Happened: A History from the Age of Reason to the Age of Algorithms
"This is an outstanding book and by far the best machine learning book of the several I have read. I highly recommend.1) The author writes this in a way that you can perform machine learning tasks in R without any prior experience using R or ML. He gets you up to speed quickly on how to download R Studio and explains everything you need to know about R in order to perform the ML tasks that are described later in the book. He doesn't explain all of the things you can do in R as in many other books, because you don't necessarily need to know everything about R to perform ML tasks and this book is about ML. So this is obviously not a book that is exhaustive of everything possible in R.2) The structure of this book is outstanding and very logical. Within each of the chapters on Machine Learning models, he describes the model and how it works, includes a section covering the model's syntax in R, the strengths and weaknesses of each model, compares the model to the prior models discussed, and then uses that foundation to walk you through an example of applying each model to real data. Within the examples, he uses the 5 steps of a modeling process: 1) collecting data, 2) exploring and prepping the data, 3) training the model, 4) evaluating model performance, and 5) Improving model performance. I love this structure!3) His explanations of everything are outstanding. I've read several ML books and he by far is the best at explaining things in a way that people can clearly understand. If the model involves statistical concepts, he explains what you need to know very well.4) The book covers many ML models: K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Classification Rules, Regression, Regression Trees, Model Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Association Rules, K-Means Clustering, and Random Forests. For an advanced Data Scientist, this may not seem like an exhaustive list. However, I feel that for a beginning data scientist or someone that is just interested in getting a good overview of data modeling, I feel this is a great choice of model coverage.Bottom line- if you're at all interested in machine learning in R, this is the book to get. If you're already an advanced data scientist with years of experience, this may not be the best text for you, though.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Machine Learning with R: Expert techniques for predictive modeling, 3rd Edition"
"I received the book just recently. I will update my review of the contents later. Two things I noticed right away are (a) The 'dataspelunking.com' website mentioned above (in the Amazon description) and in the book, is an empty shell; and (b)  The link in the preface pointing to a page containing a PDF of color-images of the screenshots/diagrams in the book is broken, leading to a 404 message. The kindest thing one can say about this is that the book has been rushed to publication and released before the associated resources are ready. At worst this is a misrepresentation. While those color figures are not a big loss, this carelessness does not bode well for the attention to detail with which the book was produced, especially since it is in its 3rd edition.Edited: Packt repaired the broken link and contacted me here to point that out.

"I'd have to say that this book is a simple and clear concise introduction to both R and ML. Probably one of the best books on ML with R I've used. It starts of with a robust introduction to R and stats that'll give you the tools to play around with R. Next, the book goes into the ML with good illustrations using physical representations for easier understanding. It goes on to some vector/component concepts in SVM (obviously) but still retains the intuitive properties of the book.  The book chapters, generally, are independent and can be read as stand alone without much loss in understanding.  Overall, a great book to give you the confidence to move forward in ML.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Machine Learning with R: Expert techniques for predictive modeling, 3rd Edition"
"So my issue with this book isn't that it's introductory. I think that fact is quite obvious, actually. My main issues are as follows:First of all, some of the code is just...odd. The author writes bizarre code that is oddly inefficient and imparts the use of inefficient code on beginners. For example, if he shows us how to extract labels for rows x to y and the labes are in a column in a dataframe, he shows us how extracts all the columns for rows x to y and then subsets out the column of interest...why???And second, i wish there was a little more thought into how the book was organized. Not in the order of chapters, but in how the chapters and example problems are appraoched. For example, the author cites packages and tells the reader to install them as they are used in a problem, instead of at the beginning. It would have been very helpful, for example, if at the beginning of each chapter, the packages and datasets used were listed, with links if applicable. Having to stop following the example problems just to install and load a package is quite annoying.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Machine Learning with R: Expert techniques for predictive modeling, 3rd Edition"

I wasn't sure how they were going to explain some of the thinking and mechanics behind the interactive media they discuss, but they do it seamlessly. The real magic of this project is the fact that Shirley and Nadieh are inviting readers into their brains, sharing the details of their thought process and the many iterations/side roads taken which ultimately lead to a final destination they couldn't have imagined at the outset. I also appreciate the mini technical ""lessons"" they include-- as someone who doesn't code myself, I still appreciated learning about the mechanics that influence their decisions.If you are someone who enjoys reading about the creative process, do yourself a favor and invest in a copy of this book for your library.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Sketches: A journey of imagination, exploration, and beautiful data visualizations (AK Peters Visualization Series)"

"If you're into Data Visualization, there's a good chance you already know Nadieh's and Shirley's work. They are widely regarded today as two of the most prominent (and creative) members of the flourishing Data Visualization community. When writing about the opposition of ""orthodoxy and eccentricity"" in data visualization, Alberto Cairo declares that ""Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu are wondrous eccentrics. Their splendid book is the product of a collaborative experimental project, Data Sketches, that might be one of the first exponents of an emerging visualization orthodoxy in which uniqueness is paramount and templates and conventions are seen with skepticism"".The structure of their collaboration, as they recount in the book, was simple: ""12 months, 12 topics, 12 projects each. We would gather our own data, create our own design, and code our visualizations from scratch, while also documenting the whole process"".And that last bit was what really got me hooked and fascinated about them, when I discovered their work, a few years ago: for each project, they (generously, openly) wrote detailed write-ups, full with sketches, ideas, bits of code, prototypes. It was so inspiring, I dare say they inspired a whole generation of data visualization practioners.When I heard they would be publishing the write-ups (and extending them) into a big, coffee table book, I knew I had to have it at home.The book is part memoir (mostly), part technical book, part design book. You won't ""learn"" data visualization with it (although you might learn some interesting concepts, tips and interesting approaches). But you'll dive into the process of two brilliant professionals. And, most important of all: you'll definitely get inspired to learn more, to experiment more, to try different approaches, wherever you are in your dataviz journey.I loved this book so so much. I had read some of the write-ups online when they came out, but having them ""materialized"" in such a beautiful form gives them another dimension. Sometimes stuff on the web seems so ""impermanent"", and I think the book really honors the work, the dedication, the generosity of sharing, teaching and opening up. In the last few weeks, when my wife and kids were fast asleep, I would sneak into the office (because you need a table to read such an ENORMOUS book) and read a couple of chapters, savoring it all. It was so delightful, it was like listening with the mind to these wonderful people recounting their ideas, their excitement, their frustrations, like I was listening to two friends talking about their latest exciting projects, their joys, their challenges.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Sketches: A journey of imagination, exploration, and beautiful data visualizations (AK Peters Visualization Series)"

It details the fundamental data competencies and understandings you should have before attempting to put together a data strategy for your organization. It’s not easy reading. IT IS POWERFUL READING.I’ve read several data strategy books, so let me compare:Data Strategy by Bernard Marr - This book is basically a collection of use cases that are presented in a logical framework. In comparison, DSSFD has very little in terms of use cases and instead focuses on the tech / data fundamentals you need to know to actually be successful with your data project.The Chief Data Officer Playbook - This book details some data strategy fundamentals (which I like), but it tends to focus a lot on telling readers how to champion data projects across an organization.

I think the addition of Dr. Efron's lively writing style is a key ingredient. For my money, this book far surpasses the previous books co-written by Dr. Hastie -- it is the most readable, the most integrated, and with the broadest audience.Note that by ""broadest audience"" I don't include people with no background in math. Rather, I mean that this book will be very useful to data scientists, ML engineers, or anyone doing statistical inference in their job. This is a serious textbook, aimed at the Master's student or first-year Ph.D. student in stats. It does not review the fundamentals of probability (and is a better book for that). Nevertheless it is approachable and has a lovely bedside manner.I can't say enough good things about the writing in this book. I have read a lot of math textbooks, and the presentation here is just splendid. Words are chosen carefully: for instance, the words ""machine learning"" are not over-used (note their absence in the title), in what I see as a deliberate attempt to keep the material grounded in statistical theory, and distinguish it from the froth pervasive in the field. Also the presentation is not cluttered with the reflexive reuse of the words ""model"" or ""parameters"" or “data”. Efron and Hastie use concrete, lively language.Also I commend Drs. Efron and Hastie for their great gift of making the text available for free online. What a contribution to the field.Bravo!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Computer Age Statistical Inference, Student Edition: Algorithms, Evidence, and Data Science (Institute of Mathematical Statistics Monographs, Series Number 6)"

"I'm the ""tech guy"" for a startup -- we need something done/built, but don't have anyone who knows how to do it? Yep, that means I'll be doing it...Knowing *nothing* about dimensional modeling, I was asked to lead the team that's now building our data warehouse. This book (described as ""the book on EDW"" by the one exec at the company who's done this before) didn't make me an expert or anything, but it provided a solid foundation of the high-level concepts and some of the major low-level issues that only come up when you're actually trying to build and maintain a data warehouse.Put another way, it didn't answer all my questions, but I was at least asking the right questions after going through it. (Ex: ""Should we handle this as an SCD-Type 1 or -Type 2 dimension?""*, rather than ""Wait, what's an SCD?"")I now spend most of my day talking and thinking about data warehouses, and I still find myself reaching for this book on a weekly basis. Take some time to read it through all the way, then keep it nearby, since it's a helpful reference guide for major concepts. (But not for any specific platform or vendor.

"This is one of the best technical books I've read on any subject. The author doesn't waste any time on tedious introductions, but jumps right into the meat of the topic, which is something I appreciate. The book spends a reasonable amount of time on theory, then dives into a bunch of case studies showing how to apply the theory to common scenarios. This is good instructional technique.The authors are opinionated, but in a good way. They express views on how things ought to be done, based on long experience, and this helps moves the novice along the learning curve. I've seen a few critiques in other reviews that the authors are repetitive or make a big deal out of obvious things. This actually is good instructional technique; if you want to shape the behavior of a student, you need to repeat things over and over, because no one gets it the first time. As for what is obvious or not, that varies among students. Even when a practice is obvious to a particular student, it doesn't mean that he will actually conform to that practice in real life. People are often lazy and undisciplined, and don't do the things they were taught in kindergarten.

"Thank you to Jacqueline M. Quinless, NetGalley, and The University of Toronto Press for my ARC of “Decolonizing Data” in exchange for my honest review.I was extremely interested in reading this because part of my job is conducting research. I have a foot in the world of writing centres and the other is in sports medicine so I think it is vital that as a researcher, especially one with multiple privileges, that I understand how colonisation affected and still affects data. In order to have accurate and representative data, one must decolonize the data, which sadly seems to not be the case in most research studies. As someone currently taking a course in qualitative methods for graduate school, this has been invaluable text to also learn from.This small (171 pages) text breaks down the colonisation practises Indigenous peoples dealt with in North American, more specifically, Canada, while also discussing how to decolonize your own data collection and interpretations. While I think it is a great starting point for researchers, I think that’s it - a starting point. I would love for Quinless to go more in depth with qualitative methodologies, discussing points around paradigms, ontologies, epistemologies, and axiologies. It would also be nice to hear from other researchers, especially Indigenous researchers, too.But I think this text is informative, lays things out well for beginning researchers but has value for more expert researchers, too. It is easy to read and understand as it is laid out in an organised way.

"I bought this book a couple weeks ago as I wanted to tweak ‘my’ colors.Let me just say that it met my expectations and then some. I thought it would give me a good understanding of what colors go well together and a little of the why behind the color choices, which it did but added so much more. I have heard the terms: hue, tint, and shade most of my life, but until this book did not really understand what they were or how to think about them in choosing colors.Once the foundational color concepts are covered, Kate switches to the ‘so what’ about color. She talks about the importance of visualizations and storytelling in the world of data and how proper color can be foundational to an effective presentation. Kate talks about the several types of color schemes to choose from (sequential, diverging, and categorical among others) and what sort of data and stories go with each paradigm. She also goes over a significant number of different chart types and how each one is good for different things.One of the greatest things about this book is the abundance of real world, practical examples delivered in simple terms.

Excellent book.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Foundations of Data Science
"Data science is put in excellent perspective in this book.  I think the book is especially oriented toward giving people interested in ""specializing"" in this field or utilizing data science some good, basic information.  As a multidisciplinary field, and one oriented toward business, government and surveillance interests, generally, it is a field that encompasses and extends into practical areas that its associated traditional area, namely statistics, has not in the past much-addressed.  Data science is an extremely interesting, technical field with broad social and ethical implications explored in this book.  Statistics is only one tool.  The authors lucidly discuss the focus on the huge amounts of valuable, unstructured data.  They point out that to make all of this useful for the goals and purposes of business, surveillance, medicine, government, etc. requires an enormous time investment in putting appropriate data together and extracting information in a usable form.  The discussion of mathematical modeling, machine learning, and the overall use of algorithms is very insightful.  The authors make it clear that data science is not merely ""deep learning"", despite the fact that the extraordinary advances in using neural nets represented by deep learning is largely responsible for much of the importance of data science today.  There are excellent perspectives of data science available on the Internet, but I think the authors of this book have provided a good supplement for this information in a deeper way.  One of the real problems in picking information out from the Internet is escaping  the ""hype"" surrounding a subject that is currently ""hot"" like data science.  This book definitely allows the interested person to separate some of the solid pieces of knowledge about what the field involves from the huge amount of ""noise"" surrounding the entire area of ""weak"" AI and machine learning.  I would recommend this book strongly to anyone seriously considering going into this field.  A point the authors stress is that weak AI, namely specialized applications, rather than broadly ""intelligent"" systems competitive with general human intelligence, has opened up a world of opportunity, promise, progress, as well as ethical dilemmas.  I personally think that data science is a great field for an enormous spectrum of technicians at all educational levels.  The book opens a window a bit on the enormous implications for our future.  It is a good start on the climb to a satisfactory knowledge of this field and its potential.  I especially recommend the book to business executives and entrepreneurs as a useful and insightful view, for developing a strategic picture of this field, that does not get into unnecessarily technical details, and is not subject to the ""hype"" and ""noise"" from the Internet.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series)

Great bookWhere can I find the source codes?,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Finance: From Theory to Practice
"[N.B.: this review is based on reading sections here and there, and on a careful reading of chapters 2, 3 and 10.] This book covers a large number of topics, with little theoretical or thematic overlap among them: bayesian methods, traditional time series methods, deep learning, dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. To paraphrase the title of the songs by Simple Talk: “ML is what you make it”. The topic are presented clearly, concisely and accurately. Because of the topic breadth, I expect this to serve primarily as a reference book, even if several chapter groups could be used as course material.While I think this book is above the average of its peers (""quant"" books on Big Data/ML/AI in finance), I was still somewhat disappointed. As a far-fetched comparison, consider the classic ""Elements of Statistical Learning"" (ELS) by Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani. Even when discussing well-trodden topics like OLS or ridge regression, the presentation felt new, engaging and original. I think this could be attributed to two factors. First, the life-long acquaintance of the authors with the subject matter; second, the topics in the book (statistical learning) were central to the book's aim (teach how to learn from data). The book uses fairly advanced math (matrix decompositions, RKHS) but if the book had been about ""Advanced Quantitative Methods for Statistical Learning"", it would have been uninteresting and forgettable. Now, let’s go back to the book at hand. Here, the goal should be in the *application* of these methods to finance. But there is preciously little of that, and what is there (e.g., on multiperiod optimal execution, or on comparison of factor models to deep factor models) is so superficial as to be pointless. For example, Factor Model estimation (and deep estimation) is not quite explained, and the comparison metric is at best a secondary one in factor model evaluation; and LQR solutions are not discussed. The book feels very removed from the work of actual quantitative traders, who should be the target audience of this work.Ultimately, whether the book succeeds or not is up to the reader. Probably for someone completely new to the topics of this book and in need of a reference, this is more than ok. My preference would still be to go for monographies, some of which freely available: the aforementioned ELS; ""Deep Learning"" by Goodfellow et al., ""Reinforcement Learning"" by Sutton and Barto (2nd ed); and the still-classic ""Dynamic Programming"" by Bertsekas. I am waiting for a book that a) selects methods that *work in financial investment* (I think I know a few) and that is organized around first-hand applications in Finance. Would it contain RL?I don’t think so. Deep learning? Yes. Latest-generation graphical models. Yes, too. All of it with plenty of commentary relative to financial event details, flow and liquidity models, and test. The simple fact is that *theory is cheap and abundant*. There are hundreds of published papers on ML in finance.It's the the successful method selection and the effort and intelligence in applying the method to a specific problem that are informative and valuable.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Finance: From Theory to Practice
"I never write a review but I felt obligated because this is a great book. I read literally half of the book and then realized that this is not a book for someone who wants to apply ML (applied science) in finance. I have a PhD in deep learning and Masters in Control theory and i don't get attracted to theory anymore. The book has a sound progression in theory with zero emphasis on case studies. I felt reading a great graduate school book where all topics are covered without knowing how such knowledge can be applied.

"This book represents a very comprehensive guide to Machine Learning techniques in Finance and serves remarkably well both the students of quantitative and computational finance, as well as a large cross-section of industry’s practitioners. As someone who worked in this field for several decades, and wrote a book on this topic, I understand very well what it takes to put together a comprehensive guide on such a subject. Very rare are the books on this topic that address properly at the same time both the theoretical aspects of the problem at hand, as well as exemplifying these concepts with meaningful practical examples.A book on application of ML to Finance is not necessary about providing tons of Py codes, and this one serves the reader very well. But it should be about setting up a strong foundation for the theories and concepts that underlie the ML machinery, as well as exemplifying these concepts with model reasoning that is applicable to real world problems. And the reader is served again extremely well from this perspective.In my opinion this book introduces several novelties in a very crowded and sometimes over published field:- A very elegant and well documented exposition on financial times series modelling, especially regarding the use of RNNs and Kalman filtering techniques;- A mathematically sound and well exemplified section on the use of Reinforcement Learning, specifically promoting the use of Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning as modern tools for Optimal Control;- Blending the ever-powerful set of Bayesian thinking into the world of financial ML, by developing an intuition for the role of functional regularization in the classical statistical setting.I read this book and followed its Py code examples with great pleasure, and I strongly recommend it to anyone that is interested in applying these modern concepts, while having a solid understanding of the Mathematics that supports it.

For example, this book presents modern approaches to modeling time series, such as recurrent neural networks as well as cutting-edge architectures, such as alpha-RNN. Uniquely, neural networks are treated here as ‘white-box’ algorithms with traceable links to traditional methods of financial engineering, such as linear regression. In turn, this enables interpretability of neural network algorithms. Also, the book gives a comprehensive description of reinforcement, inverse reinforcement, and Q-learning, supplemented by numerous illustrative materials, as well as the Python code. There is no doubt in our minds that these advanced ML approaches will become a routine in the arsenal of the future quantitative finance!Finally, we want to highlight our favorite part of this book, described in its final chapters. It relates to the classic concept of bounded rationality of financial agents that was introduced by Simon over 60 years ago. As we learned years back and are re-learning today, the real financial markets are populated with very heterogeneous types of investors. As a result, proper modeling of the financial markets and dynamics thereof requires sophisticated and more nuanced approaches. These approaches can be “borrowed” from diverse areas, including physics in general and modern physics in particular. Also, these new approaches will benefit from the interplay between “classic” ML methods, like unsupervised and supervised learning, and “newer” methods, like reinforcement and inverse reinforcement, information-based G-learning, and tensor networks. We strongly support the authors’ notion that these approaches constitute a very promising future of ML applications in finance in general and financial planning and decision-making in particular.Natali Kolker & Eugene Kolker, PhD",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Finance: From Theory to Practice
"Perfect for First Year Pharmacy Residents!  Found this book Early 2014; so fun to read and refresh your memory.  Recommended it use it for a PGY1 Pharmacy Residency Program in a large private hospital.  We bought one for each resident and had interactive weekly sessions for about 6 weeks to discuss and provide additional practical examples.  This book along with an interactive process was by far a more effective method than going through slides to bring some of the concepts home.  Just enough to satisfy the needs of a first year clinical residency program for either pharmacists or physicians and while being fun to read.  So happy that a section on Epidemiology along with Chapter 5 on Study Designs are provided since these type studies more closely mimic any clinical research project a one year pharmacy resident can complete. Obviously, more information would be needed for extensive research focus.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clinical Biostatistics and Epidemiology Made Ridiculously Simple: An Incredibly Easy Way to Learn for Medical, Nursing, PA Students, And Other Healthcare Professionals (MedMaster Medical Books)"

This book is an AMAZING reference!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clinical Biostatistics and Epidemiology Made Ridiculously Simple: An Incredibly Easy Way to Learn for Medical, Nursing, PA Students, And Other Healthcare Professionals (MedMaster Medical Books)"
"This book is wonderful. Without it I would not have passed biostatistics I. I don't even read my course textbook, I relied completely on this book and scored a ""B"" on my final. Several of my classmates also purchased this book and feel the same way as I do. Our course director is actually going to incorporate this book into the course next year. It is a short read, roughly 90 pages. The nice thing about it is you can look up the topic in the index and skip around based upon what concept you are trying to understand. The authors do a phenomenal job of breaking down concepts with minimal math. I appreciate this as incorporating math makes it way more confusing. I want to understand the fundamental concepts first.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clinical Biostatistics and Epidemiology Made Ridiculously Simple: An Incredibly Easy Way to Learn for Medical, Nursing, PA Students, And Other Healthcare Professionals (MedMaster Medical Books)"
"This is an extremely well written summary of the key concepts in biostat and epi.  If you have very limited time to learn the vocabulary and key concepts this is an excellent study guide.  Because there are multiple paragraphs on the key ideas, it is a bit of an injustice to call this an extremely good, well organized, glossary (or *very* abridged encyclopedia) rather than a traditional textbook, but that is not far off the mark.  You will not get extended stories to teach you the materials but you will get clear explanations and some nice mnemonics to help you remember the vocabulary.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clinical Biostatistics and Epidemiology Made Ridiculously Simple: An Incredibly Easy Way to Learn for Medical, Nursing, PA Students, And Other Healthcare Professionals (MedMaster Medical Books)"
"This book is great. I just started a literature review course, and I was feeling a little overwhelmed by all the biostatistical tests that were being done in all the trials that we were reviewing. I had taken a biostats course, but I barely understood was going on during that time as well. This book gave a simple explanation for most of the tests that were being discussed in the studies and helped me to better understand why the test was being done and what each test was used for.I recommend this book for someone who needs a really simplified explanation of biostats. As the title of the book implies, the author really makes biostats seem ridiculously simple.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clinical Biostatistics and Epidemiology Made Ridiculously Simple: An Incredibly Easy Way to Learn for Medical, Nursing, PA Students, And Other Healthcare Professionals (MedMaster Medical Books)"

"I am in a graduate program that deals with bioimaging and relevant statistical procedures. As an undergrad, I got straight easy ""A's"" in a high level stat class (for sociology, using SPSS). However, this new course presented formulas and symbols that I thought I already knew, and and I lost sight of the fundamental and simple principles underlying all statsThis got me back on track and grounded in the basics in a day or two. *To note again: this book's scope is not going to teach intricate formulas, etc.Thank you!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clinical Biostatistics and Epidemiology Made Ridiculously Simple: An Incredibly Easy Way to Learn for Medical, Nursing, PA Students, And Other Healthcare Professionals (MedMaster Medical Books)"
"First 3/4 is a decent review. However, the ""Ridiculously Simple"" series is known for silly pictures and mnemonics to help you remember specific ideas, this has some but only sparingly.

"The title says it all. This book is helpful especially for defining terms. However, it really did  not  simplify the concepts as much as I had hoped. The text I am using is pretty easy to read and understand. I was hoping this book would  breakdown concepts that I find difficult to understand. Instead, it explains them in a manner similar to my text. Also, it's missing information that I need explained that I was surprised not to find.

"Met and exceeded my expectations. Great walkthroughs and explanations on coding machine learning into different environment (using TensorFlow). Also good starter discussion on ML techniques. I especially liked the mx+b example of neural networks, very intuitive. Answered lots of questions I had about using my models, such as with JavaScript or using transfer learning.The last chapter on ethics / federated learning felt a little short (but the fact it was there was already good). I would have liked a little more on dealing with / identifying model drift and training on new data while not overwriting the weights of the old. Essentially more lifecycle stuff. Discussion of ML model deployment was all TensorFlow but like I really enjoyed it all.",5.0 out of 5 stars,AI and Machine Learning for Coders: A Programmer's Guide to Artificial Intelligence
"Tonight, I completed reading of Laurence Moroney’s book “AI and Machine Learning for Coders”. I enjoyed this book from cover to cover, and I am especially thankful for a few things.First, this book did a great job of explaining how tensorflow can be used to solve different types of problems, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. It even went into text generation, which got my creativity going.Second, this book is written for coders, but it does explain how neural networks work at a high level. It doesn’t drop a wall of math on the reader, which I appreciated. I feel much more comfortable now, after reading this.And finally, the book ends by discussing interpretability, bias/fairness, and Google’s AI principles. I found that to be a beautiful ending.I give this five stars. The few issues I had were trivial. This book is outstanding. I’m so much better off for having read it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,AI and Machine Learning for Coders: A Programmer's Guide to Artificial Intelligence

"Laurence is the teacher you always wish you had.  He covers every aspect of TensorFlow with deep yet tangible intelligence.  If you're worried about understanding the practice of machine learning and artificial intelligence, don't worry any longer.  This book guides you through various aspects of the TensorFlow framework, but it also leans into the varying aspects of popular AI problems.You get the full tour in this book, from NLP coding to embedding your models in edge devices.  Each section is overflowing with code samples to help you solidify what you're learning.10 out of 10, a cornerstone of any AI bookshelf.",5.0 out of 5 stars,AI and Machine Learning for Coders: A Programmer's Guide to Artificial Intelligence
"The book jumps right into training models using TensorFlow (which is kind of fun). However, the Python code is poorly written and the author implicitly assumes you are running all of it in a Google Colab (even though he did not state this and even lauded running in PyCharm). Also, as others have mentioned, links to datasets no longer work either. I eventually ran into a code example that wouldn't run and gave up.",2.0 out of 5 stars,AI and Machine Learning for Coders: A Programmer's Guide to Artificial Intelligence
"If you start with this book, watch Laurence's videos on the TensorFlow/ Google Developer youtube channel and work all the examples and exercises, you will have a solid foundation in deep learning. Then you could potentially learn more from the documentation itself or by using Aurélien Géron's book.I feel other Oreilly books should be like this.Although math is almost absent in this book (hence 'for coders'), Laurence does a great job explaining convolutions and maxpooling etc.. I've seen lectures from many sources that misattribute pixel/dimension reduction to the convolution step and not the pooling layer (worse yet, lump both together) but the author clearly explains the concepts.",5.0 out of 5 stars,AI and Machine Learning for Coders: A Programmer's Guide to Artificial Intelligence
"Laurence Moroney is an extremely gifted teacher with an uncanny ability to make optically complex tasks seem almost trivial.  For example, the chapters on time series analysis and sequencing models using AI are some of the clearest and most applicable examples that I've seen published so far (and forecasting is a very hot topic right now).  This book leverages Keras to demonstrate how some fairly astonishing things (image recognition, NLP, forecasting, etc) can happen with not that much code.  I almost think that this should be required reading for anyone concerned with AI explainability.  Thank you so much, Laurence Moroney.",5.0 out of 5 stars,AI and Machine Learning for Coders: A Programmer's Guide to Artificial Intelligence
"Laurence explains tough concept in easy way.Code in Github and website of Laurence has good examplesThis is my 3rd book on Machine Learning, and I have seen different approaches to explaining complex concepts like How CNN works? etc. The stye used by Laurence comes with many decades of experience to understand and I guess thats why he can explain so well. I am liking it :).I just finished Chapters 1, 2, and 3 with coding along the way.Will update again as I read and practice further.Thanks Laurence Moroney.Mahtab SyedMelbourne",5.0 out of 5 stars,AI and Machine Learning for Coders: A Programmer's Guide to Artificial Intelligence
L Moroney delivered a great book introducing coders to the future of computing. Helped me a lot coming from  programming with theoritical knowledge on AI and ML get into creating my own tensorflow models. In late chapters some difficult to understand topics are not explained in depth but that's not the point of the book.
